          <p>Being a turn-based roguelike, Shiren and monsters take turns when performing actions in this game.<br>Generally, turn-ending actions include movement, attacks, using an item, and stepping in place.<br>Your turn <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span> end from idling, checking item details, or otherwise navigating menus.<br>The following actions are easy to forget / mistake:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Equipping a weapon, shield, or bracelet <span class="text_turn_ending">does</span> end the turn, but equipping a projectile <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span>.</li>
            <li>Talking to an ally character <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span> end the turn.</li>
            <li>Talking to a Shopkeeper or Trader <span class="text_turn_ending">does</span> end the turn.</li>
            <li>Placing a trap on the ground <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span> end the turn.</li>
            <li>Failing to place an item on the ground <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span> end the turn.</li>
            <li>Successfully taking control of a monster using a Possession Staff <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span> end the turn.</li>
            <li>Cancelling a possession and returning to your body <span class="text_non_turn_ending">does not</span> end the turn.</li>

            <li>A new monster is generated every 50 turns.</li>
            <li>A Sheriff or Guard Dog is generated once per turn during Thief Mode.</li>

          </dl>
          <p>Enemies standing on a tile that is on fire who received fire damage due to an action by Shiren<br>will not take additional fire damage on the same turn unless they move to a different tile that is on fire.</p>
          <p>Characters other than Shiren with double or triple movement speed who receive fire damage<br>by moving to a tile that is on fire will end their turn when they receive the fire damage.</p>
          <h3 id="wind">Wind</h3>
          <p>If you linger on the same floor inside of a dungeon for a long time, a strong wind begins to blow.<br>(Also occurs inside the Training Hall and Napus Storage)</p>
          <p>The gusts happen 3 times, and Shiren is swept back to Napus Village on the third gust of wind.<br>Being swept away by wind is equivalent to collapsing, so you'll lose all items and Gitan.<br>Asuka and Mamo's items will not be lost, and items on the floor inside Napus Storage will be safe.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First gust of wind occurs on turn 1500</li>
            <li>Second gust of wind occurs on turn 1800</li>
            <li>Third gust of wind occurs on turn 2100</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Recollections that play after resuming a suspended game will include wind in the playback,<br>so you can use that to check how many gusts of wind occurred.</p>
          <h3 id="dungeon_types">Dungeon Types</h3>
          <p>There are 2 types of dungeons, which are called "Shuffle Dungeon" and "Random Dungeon".</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Shuffle Dungeon</dt>
            <dd></dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>The map for the floor is randomly selected from a set of predefined patterns.
              <ul>
                <li>The same pattern will never be repeated during an adventure.</li>
                <li>Boss floors such as Shuten Trail Hard 15F only have one pattern.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The maps are generally very pretty, and have many fine details depicting nature.
              <ul>
                <li>It's thought that Shiren 2 is among the most detailed games made for the Nintendo 64.</li>
                <li>Hallways and rooms vary in shape and feel more natural compared to lines and rectangles seen elsewhere.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Monster Houses and dungeon shops will never be generated. (Traders can still appear)</li>
            <li>Some item and monster special attack effects are nullified in this type of map.
              <ul>
                <li>Any effect that alters the shape of the map is nullified.<br>(Pickaxe, Wonder Pickaxe, Tunnel Staff, Wall Collapse Scroll, Rock Beast, Boulder Beast, explosions)</li>
                <li>Nothing happens to the water on the current floor when Evaporate Scroll or Freeze Scroll is read.</li>
                <li>Passing through walls is not allowed. (Pumphantasm family, Typhoon, Phantasm Bracelet)</li>
                <li>Note that items with piercing properties still pierce through objects and walls. (Pierce Bracelet, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Nothing happens when a Flood Trap activates, and Pitfalls deal damage without changing floors.
              <ul>
                <li>These traps are never generated in this map type, but can be brought in and set using a Trapper Bracelet.</li>
                <li>Shuten Trail Mid 12F is the only exception, where falling in a Pitfall returns you to 11F.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>There's a <span class="warning_text">glitch</span> that hard-locks the game in Shuffle Dungeon maps. <a href="/shiren2/html/system/glitches.html#shuffle_dungeon_hardlock">→Glitches</a></li>
            <li>This dungeon type occurs only on select floors of Shuten Trails, boss floors of Onigashima, and Golden Intervals.
              <ul>
                <li>In other words, Shuffle Dungeons are rarely seen in post-game dungeons.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <p><span class="text_orange">Dungeons: Small Valley, Shuten Easy (1~4F, 7F, 9~10F), Shuten Mid (3~4F, 6~7F, 9~13F),<br>Shuten Hard (1~2F, 10~15F), Golden Interval, Onigashima (16F, 25F)</span></p>

          <ul>
            <li>There are no predefined patterns, and each floor is generated completely randomly.</li>
            <li>Every tile is a ground, water, ice, wall, or unbreakable wall tile. There are no hole / bottomless pit tiles.</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>Rooms can have features such as water or ice, single column wall tiles spaced throughout the room, etc.</li>
                <li>Other features include small islands within a room, maze-like rooms with only a 1 tile radius of view, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Waterways can be generated, which sometimes have a similar appearance to hallways.</li>
            <li>Monster Houses, dungeon shops, and Traders have a chance of being generated.</li>
            <li>Golden Stairs that lead to <a href="/shiren2/html/system/golden-interval.html">Golden Intervals</a> can rarely be found hidden in a wall tile in this dungeon type.</li>
            <li>All dungeons starting with Onigashima are Random Dungeons, and have a limited field of view.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="text_orange">Dungeons: Shuten Easy (5~6F, 8F), Shuten Mid (1~2F, 5F, 8F), Shuten Hard (3~9F),<br>Onigashima, Shrine's Hidden Hole, Halfway Well, Sealed Room, Road to the End</span></p>
          <h3 id="field_of_view">Field of View</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Shiren has a set distance he can see called field of view.
              <ul>
                <li>The view radius is 1 tile in hallways, and is the entire room + 1 tile along the edge of the room inside rooms.</li>
                <li>The location of items, monsters, and statues are displayed on the map if they are within Shiren's view.</li>
                <li>Single room floors and some Shuffle Dungeon maps don't differentiate between rooms and hallways,<br>and instead have a 5 tile field of view (within a 11 tile radius).</li>
                <li>You can still see past Shiren's field of view in Shuffle Dungeons, but not in darker dungeons such as Onigashima.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Monsters also have their own field of view.
              <ul>
                <li>They'll attack Shiren if he is visible, and will chase after him into the same hallway if they see him enter one.</li>
                <li>They can seemingly see Shiren from 2 tiles away in hallways, but they won't use their special attack from that distance.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Monsters in a room will also move toward Shiren if he is standing on a tile right outside the room.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

            </li>

          <h4 id="shops">Shops</h4>
          <p>Shops are occasionally generated in Random Dungeons.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shops can be generated in Shuten Trail Mid, Shuten Trail Hard, Onigashima, Halfway Well, and Road to the End.
              <ul>
                <li>However, shops will never be generated on Shuffle Dungeon type floors.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A maximum number of 2 shops can be generated on a floor.</li>
            <li>Items are placed in the center of the room as merchandise.
              <ul>
                <li>There are typically 9 items in a shop, but smaller shops can have fewer items.</li>
                <li>Be warned that items for sale might include a <a href="/shiren2/html/system/monsters.html#ndubba">N'dubba</a> disguised as an item.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Traps can be generated inside shops, so be careful of Springs in particular.</li>
            <li>There are either 1 or 2 entrances to a shop, and Shopkeepers always stands at the entrance.</li>
            <li>Items cannot be placed on the ground where Shopkeepers stand, including the entrance.
              <ul>
                <li>Droplet Ninja family monsters will never place traps on a shop's entrance tile when defeated.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The individual items for sale vary, and are based on each dungeon's item table.</li>
            <li>Two types of shops can be generated - regular shops, and specialty shops.
              <ul>
                <li>Specialty shops only sell one category of item, such as only grass items, or only bracelets.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shopkeepers block the exit when Shiren picks up merchandise, and ask for Gitan when you talk to them.
              <ul>
                <li>Pay the amount of Gitan they ask for, and the item will become yours.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Exiting the shop without paying for the item will trigger Thief Mode.
              <ul>
                <li>For details about stealing, check out the <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/stealing-techniques.html">Stealing Techniques</a> page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you want to sell items, simply place them on the ground.
              <ul>
                <li>Shopkeepers will ask if you want to sell the items you placed when you talk to them, so select [Yes] to sell the items.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shopkeepers will fight back if attacked by Shiren, but defeating a Shopkeeper will not trigger Thief Mode.
              <ul>
                <li>They will also attack monsters that deal damage to them, and will level up when they defeat monsters.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Merchandise can be refreshed by reading a Restock Scroll.
              <ul>
                <li>All merchandise on the ground vanishes, and new merchandise is generated in the center of the room.</li>
                <li>Refreshing always generates 9 items (or fewer based on room size), no matter how many items were on the ground.</li>
                <li>Merchandise in specialty shops will still only sell the same category of items.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="walls">Walls</h4>
          <p>Walls can be found in Random Dungeons.<br>They can be broken using items like Pickaxe and Tunnel Staff.<br>Other things like monster special attacks and explosions can also break walls,<br>but explosions that occur above water will not break walls.</p>

          <h4 id="waterways">Waterways</h4>
          <p>Waterways can be found in select Random Dungeons and Shuffle Dungeons.<br>Unlike walls, you can move and attack through corners.<br>Items can fall in water, with a common cause being stepping on a Trip Stone.<br>Submerged items cannot be picked up even with a Phantasm Bracelet equipped,<br>and magic from staves will simply travel above the item.<br>Waterways can be destroyed by reading an Evaporate Scroll or Wall Collapse Scroll.</p>
          <h4 id="frozen_floors">Frozen Floors</h4>
          <p>Frozen floors can be found in select Random Dungeons.<br>They can be generated naturally, or by reading a Freeze Scroll on a floor with waterways.<br>Characters will slide up to 4 tiles when they move across frozen floors.<br>The sliding will stop if the character moves on top of an item or trap.<br>Disguised N'dubbas can be picked up as an item if Shiren was 2~4 tiles away before sliding to it.<br>Monsters with the Floating element can move across frozen floors without sliding.</p>
          <p>Stairs cannot be moved onto frozen floors.</p>
          <p>Frozen floor tiles will turn into regular ground tiles when a Wall Collapse Scroll is read.</p>
          <p>Fire can be generated on top of frozen floors, and the frozen floor does not melt. (ex: Fire Staff)<br>Lastly, monsters that are frozen in ice cannot be damaged by fire.</p>
          <h4 id="maze_rooms">Maze Rooms</h4>
          <p>Maze rooms can be found in select Random Dungeons.<br>The room resembles a maze and consists of branching hallways.<br>Shiren 2 doesn't generate floor-wide mazes, so maze rooms are usually rather small.<br>Items, traps, and stairs can be generated within the hallways of a maze room, unlike regular hallways.<br>Field of view remains the same as hallways, and Monsters can only detect Shiren if they are next to him.</p>
          <h4 id="treasure_rooms">Treasure Rooms</h4>
          <p>Treasure rooms can be found in select Random Dungeons.<br>These 4x4 rooms do not have an entrance or exit, and include 15 bags of 500 Gitan + 1 Spring.<br>You'll likely never enter one during regular play, and they can be tricky to find to begin with.<br>They can be found by using a Scout Bracelet, or by the Scout Bracelet-like effect of Monster Houses.<br>You'll need items like Wall Collapse Scroll, Tunnel Staff, Phantasm Bracelet, etc. to enter the room.</p>
          <p>They are extremely rare, only having a 1% chance of being generated on certain Random Dungeon map types.</p>

          <h4 id="1_large_room">1 Large Room</h4>
          <p>The entire floor is one large room. Shops are never generated in this map type.<br>Rectangular walls or waterways are generated in the room.<br>Both Shiren and monsters have a field of view of 5 tiles (11 tile radius).<br>Scrolls with effects that normally affect the entire room will only affect the field of view.<br>Statues will only affect tiles in a 11 tile radius, centered around the statue.<br>It can take a little while to find the stairs, thanks to the limited field of view.</p>
          <p>iDash can be used to navigate to items or stairs without regard to the field of view,<br>but it's not recommended due to the risk of running into or getting surrounded by monsters.<br>Unlike other games in the series, this map type is not guaranteed to be a Monster House.<br>Underwater Houses will never be generated when walls are present.<br>Shiren 2 doesn't have regular Monster Houses in this map type.</p>

          <h3 id="durability">Durability</h3>
          <h4 id="weapon_durability">Weapon Durability</h4>
          <p>All weapons have are assigned a random durability value of 15~60.<br>Digging using a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/weapons.html#pickaxe">Pickaxe</a>'s ability or destroying traps using a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/weapons.html#mallet">Mallet</a>'s ability lowers durability by 1,<br>and the weapon breaks once durability reaches 0.<br>When synthesizing weapons, the durability of the base weapon is unchanged.</p>
          <h4 id="bracelet_durability">Bracelet Durability</h4>
          <p>Bracelets can sometimes crack when you receive damage while they're equipped.<br>The purchasing and selling price of a cracked bracelet remains the same.</p>
          <p>The chance for a bracelet to crack is ~3%, except for the Trapper Bracelet which has a ~10% chance.<br>Bracelets other than Trapper Bracelet also have a ~9% chance to crack from explosions.</p>
          <p>Once a bracelet cracks, a durability value of 5~15 is set, and the bracelet shatters once it reaches 0.<br>Durability decreases by 1 when you're hit by an attack in the "Actions that can crack or shatter" list below.</p>
          <p>So basically, cracks are based on luck, and can occur as early as the first hit after equipping a bracelet.<br>And a cracked bracelet will never immediately shatter, but will after a little while of receiving attacks.<br>Note that this applies to bracelets equipped by Asuka as well.</p>

            <li>Certain in-game events.</li>

          <p>Shiren and his allies start at level 1, and will level up after gaining a certain amount of experience points.<br>They can reach a max level of 99, but their level resets each time they start a new adventure.<br>Some items and monsters have the ability to decrease level, and the minimum level is 1.<br>Leveling up increases max HP and <a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#base_attack">base attack</a>, and HP is restored equal to the amount of max HP you gained.<br>Allies will also gain an increase in <a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#defense">defense</a> when they level up.</p>
          <p>Shiren and his allies gain experience points at the same rate.<br>However, some items that modify level have different effects between Shiren and ally characters.<br>For example, swinging a Happy Staff at Shiren provides 500 experience points,<br>and swinging it at an ally will simply level them up.</p>
          <p>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/exp-and-stats.html">Exp & Stats</a> page for details on level up stats and required amount of experience points.</p>
          <h4 id="enemy_monster_level">Enemy Monster Level</h4>
          <p>Monsters level up and turn into a higher rank monster if they defeat other monsters or Shiren's allies.<br>Monsters can also level up from items such as Happy Staff, Happy Grass, Angel Seed.</p>
          <h4 id="ally_monster_growth">Ally Monster Growth</h4>
          <p>Ally monsters don't have experience points or level ups, but instead have what's called growth.<br>Growth occurs when an ally monster defeats an enemy monster, increasing both max HP and strength.<br>Every monster has a set growth limit, and the stat gains per growth differs between monsters.<br>Ally monsters will keep their growth between adventures, but growth will be halved if they are defeated.<br>(Growth is only halved for monsters registered to Monster Kingdom, since unregistered monsters are lost).</p>

(max: 999).<br>Max HP decreases if Shiren loses levels due to monster special attacks or item effects.<br>Note that Mamo starts with 100 HP, since it doesn't have the ability to gain levels.</p>
          <p>Remaining HP regenerates at a rate equal to 0.5% of max HP per turn.<br>Decimals accumulate, and will be reflected in the remaining HP once the value reaches 1.<br>Some HP is restored after receiving an attack if you have the 薬 or 弟 seal synthesized onto your shield,<br>but note that the HP restoration occurs after the HP loss, so if the amount of damage surpasses<br>the amount of remaining HP, you'll collapse before the HP restoration occurs.</p>
          <h4 id="monster_hp">Monster HP</h4>
          <p>Max HP increases for ally monsters when they grow stronger, and items like Life Grass<br>can be used to increase max HP for both ally and enemy monsters. (max: 9999).<br>However, max HP increases from sources other than growth are temporary,<br>and will be reset when the ally monster returns to its pot.<br>Monsters do not regenerate HP, but ally monsters will be fully healed when they return to their pot.</p>

          <p>Critical hits are determined after accuracy is checked, so they aren't a factor for accuracy.<br>On the other hand, brutal hits are determined prior to the accuracy check, and are guaranteed to connect.<br>So Taurus family monsters effectively have higher accuracy than other monsters:</p>
