          <h2 id="monster_house_characteristics">Monster House Characteristics</h2>
          <p>Monster House is a location in a dungeon where a room is packed with many monsters and items.<br>They are generated at random, and can be generated in dungeons starting with Onigashima.<br>The ground is also covered in hidden traps, so care is needed when moving around the room.
          </p>It's best to eat Sight Grass if you have it on hand, but otherwise check for traps one tile at a time.<br>If you successfully clear out a Monster House, you can claim the items as a reward.<br>Whether Monster Houses are positive or negative generally comes down to a player's skill.</p>
          <p>The message "It's a (Monster Type) House!" is displayed when you first step foot into a Monster House,<br>and the music changes to one of two Monster House themes, depending on the type.</p>
          <p>Every monster in the room will wake up the moment you enter the room,<br>and the location of all monsters on the current floor becomes visible on the map. (Like Scout Bracelet)</p>
          <p>Special Monster Houses can include high level monsters outside of the dungeon's normal monster table,<br>making them extremely dangerous. Though that also works in reverse, where Special Monster Houses<br>in deeper floors can contain low level monsters, possibly making them easier than regular Monster Houses.</p>
          <p>Note that Statues will never be generated inside of a Monster House.<br>The developers likely realized how chaotic it would be if a Bomber Statue or Trip Statue were present.</p>

            <dt>Multiple monsters or items visible near room entrance</dt>
            <dd>There's a chance the room is a Monster House.<br>The likeliness increases further if you shoot an arrow into the room and hit an unseen monster.<br>Avoid entering the room if you don't have any items needed to take on a Monster House.</dd>
            <dt>Room with many monsters visible using a Scout Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Guaranteed to be a Monster House.<br>Skip entering the room if you don't have any items needed to tackle a Monster House.<br>Check the sleeping monsters with the bracelet equipped to determine the type of Monster House.</dd>
            <dt>The "It's a Monster House!" message randomly appeared</dt>
            <dd>On rare occasions, a Dosukoi family monster can use its special attack to shift one of the sleeping monsters<br>outside of the Monster House, which results in the Monster House activating even if you're nowhere near it.<br>It's particularly annoying when there's a Landmine in the room, since a shifted item or monster could end up<br>landing on top of the Landmine, triggering an explosion and wiping out some of the items.</dd>

            <dt>If you unknowingly step into a Monster House</dt>
            <dd>Take one step back so you end up in a hallway, only having to fight one enemy at a time.<br>You can hit three monsters per attack at the entrance if you have a Razor Wind or Morning Star.<br>If there are multiple entrances, or monsters with ranged attacks are present, take another step back.<br>You'll be safe from ranged attacks, and monsters that lost sight of Shiren will wander somewhere else.</dd>

          <p>It's best to thin out monsters from outside the room before stepping inside.<br>Use items like arrows to wake up and defeat enemies one at a time.</p>
          <h3 id="ghost_house">Ghost House</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bone Dragon Family</li>
            <li>Pumphantasm Family</li>
            <li>Gale Family</li>
            <li>Yamikichi Family</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Typhoons detect Shiren from any location, and chase him at triple speed while passing through walls.<br>Pumphantasm can also attack through walls, so it really helps to have the 仏 seal (Ghost Sickle).<br>Ghost Houses are one of the few situations where Grass Effect Pot can truly shine,<br>since you can insert an Otogiriso to deal 100 damage to all monsters in the room while healing yourself.</p>
          <h3 id="drain_house">Drain House</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Twisty Hani</li>
            <li>Scorpion Family</li>
            <li>Slug Family</li>
            <li>Hunger Puppet Family</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These enemies don't have faster movement or ranged attacks, but instead have troublesome special attacks.<br>Items like Salty Bracelet, Song Bracelet, Level Lock Bracelet, and Scale Shield can block the effects.<br>Weapons with the ド seal (Drain Buster) will give you an advantage, and a Sanctuary Scroll<br>can be used to prevent Drain type monsters from attacking or using their special attacks.</p>
          <h3 id="cyclops_house">Cyclops House</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ironhead Family</li>
            <li>Golem Family</li>
            <li>Gazer Family</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Two high powered Ironhead and Golem families alongside the Gazer family could very well cause trouble.<br>Weapons with the 目 seal (Cyclops Killer) will give you an advantage here.<br>The biggest threat is Gazer's hypnosis, so it's nice to have the 山 seal (Echo Shield) as well.<br>Ironhead family mosnters can level up if they defeat monsters standing between Shiren and themselves,<br>so be careful where you stand to avoid ending up with an extra Gigahead in the room.</p>
          <h3 id="power_house">Power House</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>Bone Dragon Family</li>
            <li>Shaaga Family</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many of these monsters not only have high attack, but also have high HP.<br>One of the most dangerous types due to the presence of both Porky and Tiger Tosser families.<br>Porkton can throw stones from up to 10 tiles away, even if you're standing on a Sanctuary Scroll.<br>竜 (Dragon Killer) and 龍 (Ryujin Sword) seals will help against Shaaga and Bone Dragon families,<br>while the 目 seal (Cyclops Killer) will help against Ironhead and Golem families.<br>It's a great opportunity to earn lots of experience, but it might be best to ignore this house due to the risk.</p>
          <h3 id="throwing_house">Throwing House</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>Bored Kappa Family</li>
            <li>Water Strider</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sanctuary Scrolls won't help against projectiles, and Porky monsters toss stones even if you enter hallways.<br>The 身 (Dodge Shield) or 返 (Reflect Shield) seals offer protection against projectiles, but said shields<br>can only be obtained in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed-room.html">Sealed Room</a>, meaning you have to tackle this type of Special Monster House<br>without them in Road to the End and Shrine's Hidden Hole.</p>
          <p>Monsters like Horse Ronin and Tiger Tosser can level up by dealing damage to other monsters.<br>Bored Kappa monsters and Water Striders will throw items found on the ground as well,<br>potentially leaving you with nothing to collect as a reward for tackling the Monster House.<br>Generally, it's best to ignore this type if you discover it while wearing a Scout Bracelet.</p>

            <li>Gyadon Family</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These monsters can be quite dangerous if you don't have the 山 seal (Echo Shield).<br>Oddly, Gyadon family monsters are included in this type. (Maybe it was supposed to be Gazers?)</p>
          <p>There's a lot that could go wrong between Bat Kangaroos speeding monsters up, King Tusker and<br>Sheep Priest monsters weakening you, and Gyadon monsters plucking your equipment and items.<br>The ト seal (Walrus Shield) will prevent Gyadon monsters from being able to pluck your items.<br>Don't underestimate the attack strength of invisible monsters when a Devil Kangaroo is present.<br>You don't want to take a hit from a level 3 monster such as Emperor Tusker early on.</p>
