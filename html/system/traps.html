          <p>Traps are found on the ground, and activate when stepped on, or if an object is thrown or dropped on top of them.</p>
          <p>Allies who are thrown onto traps receive the same effect as Shiren stepping on them,<br>but ally monsters receive the effect of a monster stepping on them.<br>For example, if Asuka is thrown onto a Landmine, she will receive damage equal to 50% of her current HP,<br>but if an ally Mamel is thrown onto a Landmine, it will be instantly defeated, no matter its current HP.</p>
          <p>The "Break" column shows the chance of a trap breaking when Shiren has the trapper status<br>from either being inside the Halfway Well dungeon, or when he has a Trapper Bracelet equipped.</p>
          <p>Traps can be destroyed by splashing water on them from a Water Pot.<br>However, traps cannot be destroyed by explosions or the effect of a Flood Trap.<br>Traps thrown into water will vanish with the message "[Trap name] disappeared..."<br>Piko Hammer family monsters can destroy visible traps, and swinging a Knockback Staff<br>at a trap so that it hits a monster will deal a small amount of damage and make the trap vanish.</p>
          <p>Hidden traps cannot be detected by the [Ground] menu option,<br>but can still be destroyed by splashing water on them from a Water Pot.<br>Swinging a Mallet over a tile with a hidden trap will reveal the trap without destroying it,<br>and swinging the Mallet again over the visible trap will destroy the trap.<br>Hidden traps can be destroyed on the same turn using a Mallet if Shiren is under the effect of Sight Grass.</p>
          <p>Damage dealt by traps increases as Shiren levels up when he has the Trapper status<br>from either being inside the Halfway Well dungeon, or by having a Trapper Bracelet equipped. (<a href="">Trap Damage</a>)<br>The "Dmg" column shows the amount of damage the trap deals when Shiren doesn't have the Trapper status.<br>Shiren's level is not a factor for the amount of damage a trap deals when Shiren doesn't have the Trapper status.</p>

        <h2 class="page_heading">Experience Points</h2>
        <p>Shiren with the Trapper status gains experience points equal to 95% of the normal amount when he defeats<br>an enemy using a trap, or 75% of the normal amount if the trap doesn't defeat the enemy.<br>However, enemies defeated by a Spoil Trap will be the same amount as not defeating an enemy using other traps.<br>Lastly, Shiren only gains 20% of the normal amount if he defeats enemies using regular attacks.</p>
        <h3>Chain Trap Experience Points</h3>
        <p>Chain Traps activate all other traps in a 1-tile radius, potentially granting a large amount of experience points.<br>The chain can also be continued by placing traps at the end points of One-Way and Log traps,<br>or by placing Landmines in close proximity so that they explode one after the other.<br>The formula used in calculating experience points in a trap chain is shown below.</p>
        <p>
          n = Number of traps that successfully trapped an enemy prior to the Chain Trap activating.<br>
          m = Numer of Chain Traps that triggered due to a trap that moves an enemy (max: 1),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the number of Landmines that exploded away from a Chain Trap.<br>
          N = Number of traps that successfully trapped an enemy due to a Chain Trap activating.<br>
          M = Number of traps activated by the Chain Trap that didn't trap an enemy.<br>
          L = Number of Landmines that exploded within a 1-tile radius of a Chain Trap.<br>
          (L isn't included in M, and the number of Chain Traps isn't counted for n or N)
        </p>
        <pre class="formula">

  Exp = Normal amount * (3/4) * {n^2 + n * m * (2 * N + 1) + (1/2) * N * (N + 3) + M * (n + 1) + L * (n + N / 2)}
  However, a Chain Trap on its own: Exp = Normal amount * (3 / 4)
        </pre>
        <p>If the trap defeated an enemy, the following is added to the amount of experience points:</p>

        <h3>Multiplier Table</h3>
        <p>The following table shows the experience multiplier for a chain where the enemy is not defeated by a trap,<br>and when there aren't any traps that fail to trap an enemy in the chain, including explosion chains.</p>
        <p>
          n = Number of traps that successfully trapped an enemy prior to the Chain Trap activating.<br>
          N = Number of traps that successfully trapped an enemy due to a Chain Trap activating.<br>
          m = Number of Chain Traps (max: 1)
