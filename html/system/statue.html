        <h2>What are Statues?</h2>
        <p>Statues are one of the new gimmicks introduced in Shiren 2, and are modeled after various monsters.<br>They can be found in all dungeons starting from Onigashima except for Shrine's Hidden Hole.<br>They're said to be made by Shuten Summit residents, but also appear in Sealed Room, so they're a bit of a mystery.<br>A continuous mechanical sound can be heard when Shiren is within a 11 tile radius, so they're easy to identify.</p>
        <p>Statues provide various effects to nearby characters.<br>Some are positive and can be of help to Shiren, but others can have a negative effect.<br>Select negative effect statues will switch to affecting only monsters when Shiren has the Trapper status.</p>
        <p>Generally, the range of a statue inside a room is either room-wide, or a 1 tile radius around the statue.<br>However, the tiles along to walls are exempt from a room-wide effect.<br>If the floor is one giant room with limited view, a room-wide statue will only affect characters in a 11 tile radius.<br>If a Wall Collapse Scroll is read, the a room-wide statue will affect the entire floor.<br>That said, there are some exceptions - Ouch Statue always only affects characters within a 1 tile radius,<br>and Scout Statue always affects the entire floor, no matter where it's located.</p>
        <p>Statues will crumble after being attacked a number of times, with the durability varying based on individual statues.<br>It's best to destroy negative effect statues as soon as you come across them to lower the risk of accidents.<br>The number of hits needed to destroy statues is as follows:<br>Explosion Statue (1~2) ≦ Decoy Statue (2~5) ≦ Base Statue Durability (3~5) ≦ Ouch Statue (8~12).<br>If fire is generated on a tile where a statue is located (Blaze Scroll or Fire Staff), the statue will vanish on that turn.<br>It's good to remember that for statues that are difficult to approach, such as Ouch, Bomber, and Sleep statues.<br>Landmine and Big Landmine type explosions will make statues vanish in a single turn as well.</p>
        <p>Statues can be moved using a Knockback Staff or Pull Staff, but Swap Staff doesn't have an effect on them.<br>Dosukoi family monsters can sometimes be seen pushing statues around as well.</p>
        <p>Enemies generally avoid attacking statues, but will attack them if the statue is blocking their path.<br>Piko Hammer family monsters will attempt to break statues in addition to visible traps.<br>Allies sometimes target statues if they were attacked by them, such as Ouch Statue or Stone Toss Statue.</p>
        <p>Statues are generally treated as items when being generated, so they can be commonly found on islands.<br>They can also be generated blocking room entrances, but monsters usually destroy those right away.<br>However, statues will never be generated inside a Monster House.</p>
        <p>Lastly, an invisible and invincible statue can be generated under special conditions. (<a href="">glitches section</a>).</p>
