          <p>Special conditions fall into two categories - status conditions (ailments) and Shiren-exclusive effects.<br>Status conditions and Shiren-exclusive effects both include negative and positive effects.<br>This page also includes information on how status conditions affect monsters.</p>

          <h2 id="status_conditions_ailments">Status Conditions (Ailments)</h2>
          <p>Shiren and monsters can be inflicted by effects called status conditions.<br>Conditions with negative effects are called ailments or "bad status", and restrict the character's actions.<br>Ailments can have a drastic impact toward combat or even your adventure as a whole.<br>It's good to have some basic knowledge for each one so that they can be utilized for benefit.<br>Since there are few conditions with positive effects, they're grouped with ailments.</p>
          <h3 id="status_condition_basics">Status Condition Basics</h3>
          <p>Most effects only last a certain number of turns, and are cured after the duration expires.<br>The status conditions that last for the entire time on the floor only apply to monsters.</p>
          <p>Movement speed cannot be both slowed and hastened at the same time.<br>Think of it as the character's movement speed stage increasing or decreasing by 1.<br>There is one exception, however, where a Talk Seed effect can slow a character down<br>to 1 action every 2 turns even if they were moving at double or triple speed.</p>
          <p>Paralysis is unrelated to movement speed, and can occur even when a character is hastened.<br>If a Slow Staff is swung at a character that already has slowed movement,<br>they will become paralyzed and their movement speed stage will reset.</p>
          <p>Drinking <a href="/shiren2/html/item/castle-materials.html#good_water">Good Water</a> or <a href="/shiren2/html/item/castle-materials.html#perfect_water">Perfect Water</a> will cure all status conditions. (excluding hastened movement),<br>and being revived by <a href="/shiren2/html/item/grass.html#revival_grass">Revival Grass</a> will cure all status conditions.</p>
          <h3 id="status_condition_list">Status Condition List</h3>
          <p>For rows with two descriptions, the above one is for Shiren, and the one below is for monsters.<br>Causes that have a monster name in brackets represent a special attack used by that monster.</p>
          <p>Duration (turns) begins when Shiren first takes action after the character is inflicted by the condition.<br>For example, if a Devil Kangaroo swings its Invisible Staff at a monster,<br>in either case of the monster becoming invisible after acting or before acting,<br>the invisibility only ends after Shiren performs 20 turns worth of actions.<br>So the monster would have invisibility for 20 turns in the first case, and 21 turns in the second case.</p>
