        <p>Seals are special abilities that can be <a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#synthesis">synthesized</a> onto weapons or shields.</p>
        <p>Each seal is represented as single Japanese character, and the color depends on the source item.<br>The three colors are: equipment (blue), food/grasses (green), and scrolls (red).<br>Some seals like 金 can be found in two colors, and have a slightly different effect based on color.</p>
        <p>Generally seals can make your adventure smoother, but some of them are a double-edged sword,<br>have a pointless effect, or have an outright negative effect, so some care is needed.</p>
        <p>
        The Blacksmith at Shuten Halfway can erase unwanted seals for a fee.<br>Gyandora and Monsoon Doll's special attacks can also remove seals at random.</p>

        <h2 id="stacked_effects">Stacked Effects</h2>
        <p><strong>～Common Questions～</strong><br>
          ・Does having multiple 回 seals restore more HP? (Does it stack?) → No, only use 1 回 seal.<br>
          ・Does having multiple 弟 seals restore more HP? (Does it stack?) → Yes, multiple 弟 seals restore more HP.<br>
          ・Do seals have to be next to each other to stack the effects? → No, the order of seals doesn't matter.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>～Stacking Seals With Similar Effects～</strong></p>
        <p>
          It's sometimes more cost efficient to mix different seals with similar effects, rather than 16 of the same seal.<br>(Similar effect seal examples: 天 and 幸, 竜 and 火, に and 飯, 龍 and 竜).<br>This is because multipliers are added together, reaching equal or greater numbers while using less seal slots.<br>Fire damage reduction seals on a shield, for example: 竜 + 火 = 30% + 20% = 50% total, whereas 竜 x 2 = 35%.

        <p>The quick answer is that it comes down to play style and opinion, rather than one being strictly better.<br>Type effective seals are guaranteed to deal more damage against a selection of monsters,<br>while the 会 seal has the potential to deal more damage against all monsters.</p>

          <li>(+) Increase damage against all monsters.</li>
          <li>(+) With enough luck, you can land critical hits without many 会 seals.</li>
          <li>(-) Chance is based on the number of 会 seals. 14 seals = 100%, but it's likely not worth that amount of investment.</li>
          <li>(-) Minotaur and Megataur only appear toward the end of post-game dungeons, so it's difficult to obtain.</li>

        <p>These two shields appear to be similar at first glance, but have a number of differences.<br>Let's take a look at the pros and cons.</p>

          <dt>Dodge Shield</dt>
          <dd></dd>

        <ul>

          <li>(+) Can dodge piercing projectiles such as Silver Arrows.</li>
          <li>(-) Cannot dodge Cannonballs.</li>
          <li>(-) Cannot dodge thrown monsters, possibly leading to blocked exits in situations such as a Power House.</li>
          <li>(-) Traps activate if you're standing on one when the item falls on the ground after dodging.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly dangerous if there's a Strip or Sleep Trap on the ground beneath you.</li>

        <dl>
          <dt>Reflect Shield</dt>
          <dd></dd>
        </dl>
        <ul>
          <li>(+) Reflect most projectiles, including items and monsters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monsters thrown by Tiger Tosser monsters get reflected, meaning exits can't get blocked.</li>
          <li>(+) Can reflect Cannonballs, though the explosion can still damage you.</li>
          <li>(-) Reflected items vanish when they hit enemies, so it's not possible to collect items.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's fine if you don't need the item, but can be a problem if a Kappa monster throws your equipment<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after getting disarmed by a Kengo family monster, especially inside Sealed Room.</li>
          <li>(-) Cannot dodge piercing projectiles, including Silver Arrows and items under the effect of a Pierce Statue.</li>
          <li>(-) Shopkeepers and Traders will attack you if a reflected Cannonball's explosion damages them.</li>
          <li>(-) Cannot reflect items that have already been reflected once in the same turn.</li>
          <li>(-) Slows down the pace of the game.</li>

        <p>Neither shield can block objects falling from above.<br>Sources of objects falling from above include Droplet, Burrs, Rockfall, and Rockslide traps.<br>Though none of those deal much damage except for Rockslide Trap, and it's possible to prevent<br>traps from activating by using the カ seal from a Traproid Shield, so it's not really a big deal.</p>
        <p>If a shield has both 身 and 返 seals, you'll be able to dodge piercing items while reflecting everything else.</p>
        <p>All that said, the question remains, if you only synthesize one, which is better?</p>
        <p>Reflect Shield allows you to evade a greater number of things, since it can reflect both items and monsters.<br>Not being able to collect dodged items isn't that important for post-game dungeons, since by the time you<br>obtain a Reflect Shield, you'll likely only be interested in things that cannot be found on the ground.<br>You can also read a Slumber Scroll to prevent a Kappa monster from throwing items,<br>and you always need to act carefully around Kengo monsters to avoid having your shield disarmed.<br>Lastly, Silver Arrows from Horse Ronin monsters don't deal much damage if your shield is strong,<br>so you only really need to watch out for Pierce Statues.</p>
        <p>Dodge Shield allows you to collect items thrown by Kappa and Water Strider monsters,<br>and also lets you collect Wooden and Iron arrows from Bow Boy family monsters.<br>Dodged items can trigger traps if you're standing on one, but that situation is rare, so it's not a big concern.<br>The biggest drawback is that you can't dodge Wolf Droid bombs or Pop Tank cannonballs,<br>meaning there's a significant risk for bracelets cracking compared to Reflect Shield.</p>
        <p>In the end, the answer is that Reflect Shield is used more often, but it comes down to what you value more.</p>
