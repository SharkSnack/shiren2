          <p>Allies are NPC characters who fight monsters alongside Shiren.<br>Shiren 2 features five ally characters - Himakichi, Riku, Asuka, Kirara, and Mamo.<br>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/story_progression.html">Story Progression</a> page to check requirements for each character becoming your ally.</p>

          <p>Ally characters follow behind Shiren, and automatically move toward enemies to attack them.<br>Allies run from enemies if their HP falls below 25%, and enemies level up if they defeat an ally.<br>Shopkeepers, Sheriffs, and Guard Dogs won't attack allies, so they can be used as a shield when stealing.</p>
          <p>Allies gain experience when Shiren defeats an enemy,<br>and Shiren and other allies also gain experience if an ally defeats an enemy.<br>Generally stats like level, HP, strength, Landmine damage, etc. are the same as Shiren for allies,<br>but unlike Shiren, their defense increases with level ups, they don't have hunger,<br>and the amount of experience needed to level up differs per character.<br>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/exp_and_stat.html">Exp & Stats</a> page for details about ally stats.</p>
          <h2>Characters</h2>
          <h3 id="himakichi" class="ally_h3">Himakichi</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/himakichi.png" width="48" height="78" alt="himakichi">
          <p>A <a href="/shiren2/html/system/monster.html#bored_kappa_family">Bored Kappa</a> monster who always has more time than he knows what to do with.<br>He takes an interest in fighting Oni after some convincing by Koppa, and joins Shiren as an ally.</p>
          <p>He can catch any thrown item (ally or enemy), and will then toss it at an enemy within throwing range.<br>However, he can't catch items that have the piercing property, such as Silver Arrows.<br>Catching and throwing items doesn't use up Himakichi's turn, so he can still move or attack afterward.<br>The amount of damage the thrown item deals is based on Himakichi's attack strength.<br>Note that <strong>he can catch and throw Shiren's equipment that has been disarmed by a Kengo monster</strong>.</p>
          <p>Himakichi will drop the item on the ground if an enemy isn't within his throwing range or view.<br>However, he will throw stone items at an adjacent tile instead of dropping them on the ground.<br>If Shiren takes control of a Bow Boy family monster, he can collect Wooden Arrows, Iron Arrows,<br>or Cannonballs simply by shooting them at Himakichi.</p>
          <p>Since he's a Kappa family monster, Himakichi can go underwater, and can attack underwater monsters.<br>He also throws underwater items toward the ground beneath Shiren so that Shiren can pick them up.</p>
          <p>Himakichi will eat grass or seed items that have a positive effect,<br>and will also eat Dragon Grass or Flame Grass when he can hit an enemy with the fire breath.<br>Unlike other allies, he eats Herbs and Otogiriso, so those items can increase his max HP if at full HP.<br>If you want to hit Himakichi with a grass or seed item that he won't eat such as Antidote Grass,<br>you'll need to either seal him or equip a Pierce Bracelet to ensure he doesn't catch it.</p>
          <p>Due to his ability to catch thrown items, he's effectively invincible against Bow Boy and Boy Cart.<br>He can also throw Pop Tank Cannonballs and Wolf Droid bombs back at monsters,<br>but will get hit by the explosions if the monsters are standing next to Himakichi.<br>(If Himakichi collapses due to that, the message "Himakichi self-destructed!" will be displayed).</p>
          <p>As shown in one of the demos, you can help Himakichi defeat enemies faster by shooting arrows at him.<br>However, ideally you'll want to avoid having him fight at close range, since he has decent defense<br>but only average attack, where even Riku surpasses his attack strength starting at Lv18.<br>He's nice to have around for the Shuten Trails and <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/onigashima.html">Onigashima</a>, but the lack of power and utility<br>becomes apparant in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed_room.html">Sealed Room</a> when compared to allies like Asuka and Mamo.<br>That said, he is able to collect underwater items, so it can still be nice to bring him along.</p>

          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/riku.png" width="60" height="106" alt="riku">
          <p>A boy who lives in Napus Village.<br>He was a delicate child, but was inspired by Shiren's efforts to build a castle and becomes an ally.</p>
          <p>He can shoot a slingshot at an enemy within a 2 tile radius, dealing fixed damage based on level.<br>It's similar to Porky Stones, but it's treated as a regular attack rather than a ranged attack.<br>The slingshot cannot be reflected by Tonosamadon, and doesn't get nullified by a Hoarder Statue.<br>It is affected by Knockback Statue, and Riku will receive counter damage from a Samuraidon.</p>
          <p><strong>He tends to run toward monsters on his own despite lacking in both HP and strength</strong>.<br>He often collapses early on before you get a chance to rescue him, resulting in a leveled up monster.<br>Oddly enough, he seems to be totally fine as if nothing happened when you return to the village.<br>This tendency to collapse easily can be used to level up a monster for more experience in Sealed Room<br>(ex: Stun Scorpion on 1F = 4,900 exp), or to capture a higher level monster for Monster Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Due to this tendency, the nickname "Blue Snacky" became popular over time.<br>A proper blue colored Snacky family monster was then introduced in Shiren 4,<br>and one of the night-time monsters in Shiren 5 includes a reference to Riku as the Blue Snacky.</p>
          <p>Some players have fun doing a <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/restricted_play.html">Restricted Play</a> where Riku must be kept alive until 99F in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed_room.html">Sealed Room</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="asuka" class="ally_h3">Asuka</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/asuka.png" width="68" height="120" alt="asuka">
          <p>A wanderer who was rescued by Shiren when she was surrounded by Kengo monsters at Shuten Halfway.<br>She joins Shiren from that point, and proves to be an invaluable ally throughout his adventure.</p>
          <p>She is the only ally character who can equip weapons, shields, and bracelets (excluding 2-handed).<br>Asuka equips these items by catching them in the air when they are thrown her way,<br>and can therefore save Shiren's equipment if it gets knocked away by a Kengo monster.<br>Asuka will prioritize equipping thrown items, even if she has a Reflect Shield or Dodge Shield equipped.</p>
          <p>However, <strong>if she is currently unable to act (ex: sleeping), the thrown item will simply hit her</strong>.<br>Also, <strong>she cannot catch items with piercing properties</strong>, so be sure to unequip Pierce Bracelet<br>and check for possible Pierce Statues in the room before throwing equipment at her.<br>If you neglect to do so, you might end up accidentally one-shotting her if you throw powerful equipment.</p>
          <p>If Asuka equips a cursed item, you can read a Purify Scroll while standing next to her to remove the curse.</p>
          <p>As for seals on equipment, Asuka will actively make use of 火 and 水 on her own.<br>Other seals still take effect, but she will never dig walls with 掘 or サ, or break traps with 木 or 鉄.<br>Note that Asuka won't attack an enemy unless the enemy is directly in front of her,<br>so she won't attack around corners or such with the 三 seal. (But her attacks still hit in a 3-way pattern).<br>Since she doesn't have hunger, she can equip Heavy Shield and Heal Bracelet without any negatives.</p>
          <p>If both of you have Phantasm Bracelets equipped, Asuka will follow you over water and through walls.<br>Like Shiren, she loses HP every turn she spends inside a wall, so you'll want to keep an eye on her HP.</p>
          <p>Asuka will drop her equipment on the ground if she is defeated.<br>However, if Shiren was the only one to collapse inside of a dungeon, her equipment won't be lost, but<br><span class="warning_text">if you select "Return to Napus Village" from the main menu / copy a journal, she will lose her equipment.</span><br>It also appears she can lose her equipment as a result of certain event scenes,<br>so if you care about her equipment, it's best to store the items inside Napus Storage when not in use.</p>
          <p>Asuka will drop her previous equipment on the ground if you throw a new piece of equipment at her.<br>If you don't have 2+ weapons or shields (or 3+ bracelets), you'll have to defeat her to reclaim equipment.</p>
          <p>Overall, giving her powerful equipment and bringing her along is like having 2 Shirens inside the dungeon,<br>so there's no contest who the strongest ally character is, as Asuka leaves the other four in the dust.<br>Even if you take her weapon away, she still has the best base attack growth rate,<br>and you can have her equip a shield to cover for any lack of HP or defense.</p>
          <p>She's the only ally able to fight monsters in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed_room.html">Sealed Room</a> on even footing,<br>and you can further increase her damage output by having her equip two Strength Bracelets.<br>However, even when she has powerful equipment, you'll still want to keep an eye on her<br>since she won't hesitate to rush toward Kengo and Weather Doll family monsters by herself.</p>
          <h3 id="kirara" class="ally_h3">Kirara</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/kirara.png" width="68" height="111" alt="kirara">
          <p><a href="/shiren2/html/system/monster.html#boss_oni">Boss Oni</a>'s daughter.<br>Shiren helped her out of a trap prior to arriving at Napus Village, but she left without a thanks.<br>However, she grows a crush on Shiren as she watches him build a castle, and later joins him as an ally.</p>
          <p>She can breathe fire at monsters from a distance, dealing a fixed amount of damage based on her level.<br>Early game monsters can be wiped out quickly thanks to this ability,<br>but unlike a Dragon's breath attack, she can't breathe fire at targets around corners.<br>She will never breathe fire in a way that the flame accidentally hits Shiren.</p>
          <p>Kirara is immune to fire damage, and therefore is a decent counter against Dragon family monsters.<br>Sources for fire damage include: Blaze Scroll, Fire Staff, Flame Grass, Dragon Grass,<br>Dragon family monster special attacks, and the 火 seal on a weapon.</p>
          <p>She has higher base attack than Himakichi and Riku, and has average defense.<br>She can prove to be a reliable ally for the Shuten Trails and <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/onigashima.html">Onigashima</a>, but like Himakichi and Riku,<br>her inability to equip weapons or shields leaves her underpowered for <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed_room.html">Sealed Room</a>.</p>
          <p>Despite being a member of the Oni family, nothing happens when Oni repelling <a href="/shiren2/html/item/material.html#water">Water</a> is thrown at her.<br>...Yes, someone was mean enough to try that.</p>

          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/mamo.png" width="80" height="110" alt="mamo">
          <p>Shuten Mountain's guardian deity, Mamori Gami, entered the physical realm as a dresser to help Shiren.<br>Despite having the appearance of a dresser, Mamo is able to walk and talk like other characters.<br>Unlike other allies, Mamo never attacks monsters, but can instead store up to 10 items inside its drawers.<br>In other words, it's essentially <strong>a walking high-grade Storage Pot[10]</strong>.<br>It can store any item including castle materials and pots, though note that items inside pots will vanish.<br>Simply talk to Mamo to deposit or retrieve items from its drawers at any time.</p>
          <p>Mamo has 100 HP and 20 defense (= 40 shield strength), so it can withstand quite a few hits early on.<br>However, Mamo cannot level up, so its stats never grow beyond those numbers.<br>Monsters generally ignore Mamo for the most part, but will attack if Mamo is blocking the way<br>such as in hallways, or if Mamo is lined up with a monster that has a ranged attack.</p>
          <p>If Mamo is defeated, all items that were inside its drawers will be spread on the ground.<br>Some items will vanish if there isn't enough space for them to be dropped on the ground,<br>such as if Mamo is defeated in a hallway and was carrying 4 or more items. (only space for 3 items).<br>So it's best to keep an eye on Mamo at all times, and avoid having it wander into hallways on its own.</p>
          <p>Unlike Shiren GB2, items thrown at Mamo will simply hit them rather than storing the item in its drawers,<br>so it's <strong>easy to lose equipment if you encounter a Kengo in a hallway with Mamo behind you</strong>.<br>Given that fact, it's best to be extra careful on floors where Kengo family monsters can appear.</p>
          <span class="warning_text">Mamo's items will vanish if you select "Return to Napus Village" from the main menu / copy a journal.</span>
          <h2>Dialogue</h2>
          <p>Talk to allies in dungeons to get a rough idea how much HP they have left without ending your turn.<br>Note that the amount of HP displayed when using a Knowledge Staff represents their max HP.<br>There are four levels of dialogue based on remaining HP. (1~24%, 25~49%, 50~74%, and 75~100%).<br>Alternate lines are spoken when an ally gets hit or caught by a trap, or when an ally defeats a monster.<br>Lastly, allies will have different dialogue altogether outside of dungeons.</p>
