          <p>Allies are NPC characters who fight monsters alongside Shiren.<br>Shiren 2 features five ally characters - Himakichi, Riku, Asuka, Kirara, and Mamo.<br>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/story_progression.html">Story Progression</a> page to check requirements for each character becoming your ally.</p>

          <p>Ally characters follow behind Shiren, and automatically move toward enemies to attack them.<br>Allies run from enemies if their HP falls below 25%, and enemies level up if they defeat an ally.<br>Shopkeepers, Sheriffs, and Guard Dogs won't attack allies, so they can be used as a shield when stealing.</p>
          <p>Allies gain experience when Shiren defeats an enemy,<br>and Shiren and other allies also gain experience if an ally defeats an enemy.<br>Generally stats like level, HP, strength, Landmine damage, etc. are the same as Shiren for allies,<br>but unlike Shiren, their defense increases with level ups, they don't have hunger,<br>and the amount of experience needed to level up differs per character.<br>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/exp_and_stat.html">Exp & Stats</a> page for details about ally stats.</p>

          <h3 id="himakichi" class="ally_h3">Himakichi</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/himakichi.png" width="48" height="78" alt="himakichi">
          <p>A <a href="/shiren2/html/system/monster.html#bored_kappa_family">Bored Kappa</a> monster who always has more time than he knows what to do with.<br>He takes an interest in fighting Oni after some convincing by Koppa, and joins Shiren as an ally.</p>
          <p>He can catch any thrown item (ally or enemy), and will then toss it at an enemy within throwing range.<br>However, he can't catch items that have the piercing property, such as Silver Arrows.<br>Catching and throwing items doesn't use up Himakichi's turn, so he can still move or attack afterward.<br>The amount of damage the thrown item deals is based on Himakichi's attack strength.<br>Note that <strong>he can catch and throw Shiren's equipment that has been disarmed by a Kengo monster</strong>.</p>
          <p>Himakichi will drop the item on the ground if an enemy isn't within his throwing range or view.<br>However, he will throw stone items at an adjacent tile instead of dropping them on the ground.<br>If Shiren takes control of a Bow Boy family monster, he can collect Wooden Arrows, Iron Arrows,<br>or Cannonballs simply by shooting them at Himakichi.</p>
          <p>Since he's a Kappa family monster, Himakichi can go underwater, and can attack underwater monsters.<br>He also throws underwater items toward the ground beneath Shiren so that Shiren can pick them up.</p>
          <p>Himakichi will eat grass or seed items that have a positive effect,<br>and will also eat Dragon Grass or Flame Grass when he can hit an enemy with the fire breath.<br>Unlike other allies, he eats Herbs and Otogiriso, so those items can increase his max HP if at full HP.<br>If you want to hit Himakichi with a grass or seed item that he won't eat such as Antidote Grass,<br>you'll need to either seal him or equip a Pierce Bracelet to ensure he doesn't catch it.</p>
          <p>Due to his ability to catch thrown items, he's effectively invincible against Bow Boy and Boy Cart.<br>He can also throw Pop Tank Cannonballs and Wolf Droid bombs back at monsters,<br>but will get hit by the explosions if the monsters are standing next to Himakichi.<br>(If Himakichi collapses due to that, the message "Himakichi self-destructed!" will be displayed).</p>
          <p>As shown in one of the demos, you can help Himakichi defeat enemies faster by shooting arrows at him.<br>However, ideally you'll want to avoid having him fight at close range, since he has decent defense<br>but only average attack, where even Riku surpasses his attack strength starting at Lv18.<br>He's nice to have around for the Shuten Trails and <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/onigashima.html">Onigashima</a>, but the lack of power and utility<br>becomes apparant in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed_room.html">Sealed Room</a> when compared to allies like Asuka and Mamo.<br>That said, he is able to collect underwater items, so it can still be nice to bring him along.</p>

          <img src="/shiren2/image/ally/riku.png" width="60" height="106" alt="riku">
          <p>A boy who lives in Napus Village.<br>He was a delicate child, but was inspired by Shiren's efforts to build a castle and becomes an ally.</p>
          <p>He can shoot a slingshot at an enemy within a 2 tile radius, dealing fixed damage based on level.<br>It's similar to Porky Stones, but it's treated as a regular attack rather than a ranged attack.<br>The slingshot cannot be reflected by Tonosamadon, and doesn't get nullified by a Hoarder Statue.<br>It is affected by Knockback Statue, and Riku will receive counter damage from a Samuraidon.</p>
          <p><strong>He tends to run toward monsters on his own despite lacking in both HP and strength</strong>.<br>He often collapses early on before you get a chance to rescue him, resulting in a leveled up monster.<br>Oddly enough, he seems to be totally fine as if nothing happened when you return to the village.<br>This tendency to collapse easily can be used to level up a monster for more experience in Sealed Room<br>(example: Stun Scorpion on 1F = 4,900 exp), or to capture a higher level monster for Monster Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Due to this tendency, the nickname "Blue Snacky" became popular over time.<br>A proper blue colored Snacky family monster was then introduced in Shiren 4,<br>and one of the night-time monsters in Shiren 5 includes a reference to Riku as the Blue Snacky.</p>
          <p>Some players have fun doing a <a href="/shiren2/html/playing/restricted_play.html">Restricted Play</a> where Riku must be kept alive until 99F in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/sealed_room.html">Sealed Room</a>.</p>
