          <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
          <h3 id="diagonal_movement">Diagonal Movement</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/diagonal_movement.png" width="140" height="100" alt="diagonal_movement.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>Diagonal movement is one of the simplest but most important techniques in the game.<br>It might take some practice, but it will help you navigate around monsters, and save on turns in general.</p>
          <h3 id="lure_enemies">Lure Enemies</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/lure_monster.png" width="565" height="106" alt="lure_monster.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>If you encounter an enemy in a room or hallway with a 1 tile gap:<br>
          ＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿<br>
          [Shiren] [　] [Enemy]<br>
          ￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>
          Instead of moving toward the enemy, swing your weapon so that the enemy moves toward you:<br>
          ＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿<br>
          [Shiren] [Enemy]←<br>
          ￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>
          That way you'll avoid giving the first hit to the enemy.
          </p>
          <h3 id="fight_in_hallways">Fight in Hallways</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/use_hallways.png" width="485" height="180" alt="use_hallways.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>If there are multiple monsters in the room, move into a hallway and fight them one at a time.<br>Getting surrounded means you'll end up taking damage from multiple attacks each turn.<br>Shiren can normally only attack one monster at a time, so nothing good will come from<br>trying to take on multiple enemies at the same time.</p>
          <h3 id="step_in_place_to_recover_hp">Step in Place to Recover HP</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/step_in_place.png" width="210" height="150" alt="step_in_place.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>You can step in place and fast-forward turns by holding A+B.<br>This will let you quickly recover HP without moving, and should be done<br>before proceeding to other rooms if your HP is low.<br>However, you'll want to keep an eye on your fullness if you use this technique very often.</p>
          <h3 id="use_items_in_a_pinch">Use Items in a Pinch</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/use_items.png" width="687" height="170" alt="use_items.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>If you collapse in a dungeon, you'll lose all of your items.<br>So if you find yourself in a pinch, don't hesitate to use items.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Herb or Otogiriso to restore HP.</li>
            <li>Swift Grass if you want a movement advantage.</li>
            <li>Warp Grass if you need a quick escape.</li>
            <li>Decoy Scroll if you want to avoid taking damage.</li>
            <li>Arrows or Cannonballs if you want to defeat enemies from a distance.</li>
          </ul>
          And so on - make use of your items depending on your current needs.
          <h2 id="riceballs">Riceballs</h2>
          <h3 id="keep_them_in_storage_pots">Keep them in Storage Pots</h3>
          <p>Riceballs will not spoil over time, but can spoil from outside factors such as stepping on a Spoil Trap.<br>However, they can be protected from spoiling by simply placing them inside pots.</p>
          <p>It might not seem like a big deal during the Shuten Trails since you can buy new riceballs at Shuten Halfway,<br>but lowering the number of turns/actions you can perform before starving is a pretty significant hit.<br>It's best to get in the habit of placing riceballs inside Storage Pots now,<br>so that you'll have an easier time once you reach the later dungeons.</p>
          <h3 id="when_to_eat">When to Eat</h3>
          <p>Ideally, you'll want to eat riceballs when none of the restored fullness goes to waste.<br>For example, if you eat a Large Riceball (restores 100%) at 20/100% fullness, 20% fullness is wasted.<br>So instead, it's best to eat the Large Riceball the moment your fullness reaches 0%.</p>
          <p>Food is extremely valuable, since it increases the number of turns / actions you can perform before starving.<br>Remember, wait until none of the fullness goes to waste before eating, especially during early game.<br>Eating grass items also restores 5% fullness, so it's best to eat them when you're not at max fullness.</p>
          <h3 id="eating_order">Eating Order</h3>
          <p>There are 5 types of riceballs in Shiren 2, and some should be prioritized over others.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>When you don't have a Storage Pot, or have few riceballs:</dt>
            <dd></dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>Giant Riceball</li>
            <li>Large Riceball</li>
            <li>Riceball</li>
            <li>Specialty Riceball</li>
            <li>Spoiled Riceball</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The scariest thing about not having riceballs inside Storage Pots is stepping on a Spoil or Flood trap.<br>No matter how good the riceball is, it'll be reduced to a Spoiled Riceball if you step on those traps.<br>Therefore, you should prioritize eating the best riceballs first to lower the risk of them going to waste.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>When you have a Storage Pot:</dt>
            <dd></dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>Giant Riceball</li>
            <li>Specialty Riceball</li>
            <li>Riceball</li>
            <li>Large Riceball</li>
            <li>Spoiled Riceball</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Giant Riceball should still be prioritized because it increases max fullness by 7%.<br>It's common to end up with multiple riceballs over time when you have a Storage Pot,<br>so the idea is to prioritize eating riceballs with low fullness restoration to free up inventory space.</p>
          <h2 id="level_up_by_defeating_strong_enemies">Level Up by Defeating Strong Enemies</h2>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/level_up_monster.png" width="863" height="160" alt="level_up_monster.png">
          <p>Eating <a href="/shiren2/html/item/grass.html#happy_grass">Happy Grass</a> increases level by 1, but it can also be thrown at a monster to level them up.<br>You can utilize this to create a strong enemy, and then defeat them for a large amount of experience points,<br>with the end result of gaining multiple level ups as opposed to just one from eating the Happy Grass.</p>
          <p><a href="/shiren2/html/item/staves.html#happy_staff">Happy Staff</a> can also be used to level up an enemy monster.<br><a href="/shiren2/html/system/monsters.html#snacky">Snacky</a> can spawn on early floors in dungeons like <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/road-to-the-end.html">Road to the End</a>,<br>possibly resulting in a monster defeating it and leveling up.<br>Leveling up a Pit Mamel into a Cave Mamel early on is highly recommended.</p>
          <p>Of course, higher level enemies are much stronger, so you have to be careful with how you defeat them.<br>There are many ways to defeat high level enemies, but here are some ideas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deal lots of damage in a single hit by throwing Gitan or using Flame Grass, Dragon Grass, etc.</li>
            <li>Slow the enemy or eat Swift Grass, and then loop attack → step back → attack → step back.</li>
            <li>Step on a Poison Trap so that the Poison Arrow hits the monster, lowering their strength to 0.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For example, if you have 5 弟 seals on a shield, 15 HP will be restored every time you get hit by an attack.<br>So, stacking 5 弟 seals pretty much nullifies any attack that deals 15 or less damage!<br>The HP restoration also takes effect when you're hit by ranged attacks like Dragon fire.<br>Furthermore, whereas the HP restoration only takes effect once per turn with weapons (1 attack per turn),<br>there's no limit for shields - you'll restore HP after each and every hit you take on that turn.</p>
          <p>As you can see, 弟 on a shield is easily one of the best seals in the game to help with consistency.<br>Prioritize synthesizing it onto your shield once you reach Shuten Trail Hard.</p>
          <p>Lastly, if you obtain a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/bracelets.html#phantasm_bracelet">Phantasm Bracelet</a> in one of the post-game dungeons, it can be a good idea<br>to synthesize 弟 seals onto your weapon so that you can stay inside walls longer too.</p>
          <h2 id="how_to_handle_curses">How to Handle Curses</h2>
          <p>Equipment found on the ground can sometimes be cursed. (呪 seal).<br>The curse doesn't affect the equipment's strength or abilities, but you won't be able to unequip the item.</p>
          <p>In Shiren 2, only weapons, shields, and bracelets can be cursed.<br>And to reiterate, the only effect of a curse is that it prevents the item from being unequipped.<br>Other item categories cannot be cursed, and upgrade values and abilities are not affected.</p>
          <p>So while it might sound mild compared to other games, cursed equipment can still be troublesome.<br>It prevents swapping equipment, synthesizing, and unequipping bracelets to keep them from shattering.</p>

            <dd>Some ideas include...</dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>Read a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/scrolls.html#purify_scroll">Purify Scroll</a> to remove curses from all equipped items.
              <ul>
                <li>It only removes curses from <strong>equipped</strong> items, so equip cursed items before reading the scroll.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#synthesis">Synthesize</a> in a way that avoids the transfer of the 呪 seal to the base item.
              <ul>
                <li>Curses are synthesis seals in Shiren 2. (呪 seal).</li>
                <li>As long as the base item has filled seals, cursed equipment can be synthesized without the curse transferring.</li>
                <li>However, since cursed equipment comes with -1 upgrade value, the base item will become slightly weaker.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Take control of a <a href="/shiren2/html/system/monsters.html#straw_voodoll_family">Straw Voodoll</a> family monster using a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/staves.html#possession_staff">Possession Staff</a>.<br>　What gets purified depends on the level of the monster:<br>　Straw Voodoll → equipped shields.<br>　Nailed Voodoll → all equipped items.<br>　Spiked Voodoll → all equipment in your inventory, exluding items in pots.
              <ul>
                <li>In other words, if your items get cursed by a Straw Voodoll family monster,<br>you can immediately undo the curse by taking control of them using a Possession Staff.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Let Gyandora pluck the cursed equipment. (It can also pluck other equipment in your inventory).
              <ul>
                <li>Gyandora can pluck your equipped items, including those that are cursed.</li>
                <li>The random seal erasing effect could erase the 呪 seal if you're lucky.</li>
                <li>However, note that the number of seal slots will also decrease by 1.</li>
                <li>Monsoon Doll won't erase the 呪 seal, so they cannot be used to remove curses.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Have the Blacksmith erase the 呪 seal at Shuten Halfway. (Weapon or shield only).
              <ul>
                <li>This only works for cursed items that are not currently equipped.</li>

          <h2 id="making_bracelets_last">Making Bracelets Last</h2>
          <p>Bracelets can shatter in Shiren 2, and there is no way to make them unbreakable.</p>
          <p>All bracelets eventually crack and shatter from enemy attacks,<br>but this section aims to examine ways to prevent the inevitable for as long as possible.<br>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#bracelet_durability">Gameplay Basics</a> page for details on durability values / crack and shatter conditions.</p>
          <h3 id="when_to_equip_unequip">When to Equip / Unequip</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Unequip when fighting enemies</dt>
            <dd>This is one of the key rules. You might get away with not unequipping bracelets a few times,<br>but keeping them equipped during fights will guarantee that they crack sooner than later.<br>Other actions can cause bracelets to crack, but monster regular attacks are the most common cause.<br><br>For valuable bracelets like Scout Bracelet, you should unequip them even at the risk of receiving damage.<br>It's also good to get in the habit of keeping Pierce Bracelet unequipped while not in use,<br>so that you don't accidentally lose equipment when throwing items at Mixer or Synthesis Pots at walls.<br><br>That said, there are exceptions to this rule.<br>Bracelets that help evade attacks and effects (ex: Salty, Parry, Paper Thin) or boost offensive power (ex: Strength)<br>should be treated as consumable items and worn when needed during combat.<br><br>※ How to unequip 2 bracelets at the same time<br>If you have 2 valuable bracelets equipped and are about to receive an attack on the next turn,<br>you can insert both bracelets into a Storage Pot to unequip both at the same time.<br>This only works if you have a Storage Pot with 2 or more free slots, but can be good to remember.</dd>
            <dt>Unequip when walking through rooms</dt>
            <dd>This is to prevent bracelets from receiving damage due to traps like Trip Stone, Landmine, Rockfall, etc.<br>Explosions from landmines, bombs, and cannonballs have a greater chance to crack bracelets.<br>They shouldn't break from these damage sources, but a crack signals the countdown to shattering,<br>so if you're the type to skip checking for traps, keep this in mind.</dd>
            <dt>Unequip when advancing to the next floor</dt>
            <dd>There's no way to tell what's waiting for you at the beginning of the next floor,<br>so it's best to unequip bracelets beforehand in case you start in the middle of a Monster House, etc.<br>This is especially the case in deeper floors where Typhoon can shatter bracelets in the blink of an eye.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3 id="dangerous_monsters">Dangerous Monsters</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Ironhead Family</dt>
            <dd>Its head is a ranged attack, but unlike arrows, it's treated as a physical attack so bracelets will take damage.</dd>
            <dt>Taurus Family</dt>
            <dd>Brutal hits seem to have a higher chance to crack bracelets.<br>They're difficult to one-shot thanks to their high HP, so bracelets are likely to take damage from counter attacks.</dd>
            <dt>Pop Tank, Cranky Tank</dt>
            <dd>They fire cannonballs from a distance even if you're not directly lined up with them,<br>often causing bracelets to crack before you have a chance to unequip them if you're caught off guard.<br>Cranky Tank is troublesome in particular because it can fire cannonballs and move at double speed.</dd>
            <dt>Fast Monsters (ex: Gale Family), Nashaaga and Lashaaga</dt>
            <dd>Getting hit by 2~3 attacks per turn instead of 1 means bracelets can shatter that much faster.</dd>
            <dt>Wolf Droid Family</dt>
            <dd>Gorilla Bot and Bear Borg can toss bombs from greater distances.<br>However, unlike Porky family monsters, they only toss bombs if Shiren is within view.</dd>
            <dt>N'dubba</dt>
            <dd>They get a surprise attack in when they reveal themselves, making it easy for bracelets to take damage.<br>N'dubba 60yr ~ 77yr moves at double speed, so it's best to unequip bracelets before picking up items.<br>If that's too much work, at the very least unequip bracelets when you check merchandise inside shops.</dd>
            <dt>Nailed Voodoll, Spiked Voodoll</dt>
            <dd>If your equipped bracelets get cursed, you won't be able to unequip them when fighting monsters.<br>Curses are not treated as seals for bracelets, (bracelets don't have seals to begin with),<br>so unlike weapons and shields, there's no way to protect bracelets through synthesis.<br><br>It's possible to unequip bracelets before Nailed Voodoll has a chance to curse equipped bracelets,<br>but Spiked Voodoll will curse all equipment in your inventory, even if they're not equipped.<br>If you're up against a Spiked Voodoll, you can place the bracelet on the ground or in a Storage Pot.<br>You can also protect bracelets from curses by synthesizing the 祓 seal (Holy Shield, Purify Scroll) onto your shield.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3 id="if_you_still_have_trouble">If you still have trouble...</h3>
          <p>If you still frequently end up with cracked and shattered bracelets despite your best efforts,<br>consider stocking up on either additional copies of the bracelet, or Plating Scrolls to mend cracked bracelets.</p>
          <p>For example, if you have a stock of Scout Bracelets or Phantasm Bracelets inside a Storage Pot,<br>you can swap one out when it cracks and repair it at Shuten Halfway / read a Plating Scroll to mend it later.<br>Scout Bracelets can be found in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/shuten-trail-hard.html">Shuten Trail Hard</a>, so stocking up on them shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
          <p>You could also synthesize the 見 seal (Evasive Shield) or equip a Paper Thin Bracelet to increase evasion,<br>which will help bracelets last longer thanks to enemy attacks missing more often.</p>

            <dd>The simplest and quickest method - all you have to do is read the Evaporate Scroll.<br>Once the water evaporates, walk over to the item and pick it up.<br>※ Only works in Random Dungeon maps.</dd>
            <dt>Freeze Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Similar to Evaporate Scroll, all you have to do is read the Freeze Scroll.<br>Items that were underwater will be moved on top of the ice, so walk over to the item and pick it up.<br>※ Only works in Random Dungeon maps.</dd>
            <dt>Wall Collapse Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Like the above two scrolls, all you have to do is read the Wall Collapse Scroll.<br>The entire floor will be turned into one large room with regular ground tiles, so walk over to the item and pick it up.<br>※ Only works in Random Dungeon maps.</dd>
            <dt>Specific Monster Pots + Possession Staff</dt>
            <dd>You can collect underwater items if you take control of monsters that can pick up or steal items.<br>This includes monsters like Water Strider, Bored Kappa family, and Zalokleft family.<br>Water Strider drops its item when it returns to its pot, so you can collect items without a Possession Staff.<br>However, it might throw the item at a nearby enemy, so be sure to clear the room beforehand.<br>With Bored Kappa, simply move on top of the item and throw it toward dry ground.<br><br>Zalokleft will drop the item it stole when it returns to its pot,<br>but it's trickier to use than the other two because it warps away when it steals an item.<br>It can take a long time to return to where you were, and Zalokleft is easily defeated by enemy monsters.<br>Note that you can use a Possession Staff on enemy versions of these monsters too,<br>so you don't have to have the Monster Pots with you if these monsters appear in the monster table.</dd>
            <dt>Sanctaruy Scroll</dt>
            <dd>This is likely more trouble than it's worth, but it's one of the few uses for a Sanctaruy Scroll.<br>Place it on the ground so that items hop around, and then hope the item eventually lands on dry ground.<br>Once the item is on ground, you can pour water from a Water Pot onto the Sanctaruy Scroll to disable the effect.<br>This method is unreliable if the item is far from land, or if there are many underwater items.</dd>
            <dt>Dosukoi Family Monster</dt>
            <dd>This method is almost never used because there has to be both water and Dosukoi monsters on the current floor.<br>The idea is the same as Sanctaruy Scroll, where you hope Dosukoi's special attack shifts the item onto dry ground.<br>Dosukoi will only stamp the ground if Shiren is not in the same room,<br>and Hakkeyoi cannot shift items around with its special attack.<br>Use items like Unlucky Staff or Happy Staff to adjust their levels as needed.</dd>

          <p>60 items can be deposited through the attendant, and 35 items can be placed on the floor. (95 items total).<br>This might seem like a lot, but once you clear Onigashima and reach post-game,<br>you'll likely run out of storage space quickly if you try to store everything.</p>
          <p>Items inside pots will vanish when they are left in storage, and the pot's size will not be returned to normal.<br>This can make it a bit of a chore to manage items when entering dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.<br>So this section aims to offer tips and techniques to make the most of the available storage space.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Take items out of pots</dt>
            <dd>As mentioned above, items inside pots will vanish when left in storage, so take out all items before depositing them.<br>Pour out all water from Water Pots before leaving them in storage as well.</dd>
            <dt>Deposit important items</dt>
            <dd>Talk to the man on the right inside the storage for details why this should be done.<br>Such items include strengthened equipment, rare bracelets and grasses, staves with lots of uses, etc.</dd>
            <dt>Place pots on the floor</dt>
            <dd>Being able to pick up commonly used items like Storage Pots saves time when heading to dungeons.</dd>
            <dt>Synthesize staves together</dt>
            <dd>Combining same name staves adds the number of uses together, and also saves on storage space.</dd>
            <dt>Synthesize items you plan on synthesizing</dt>
            <dd>If you have secondary items that you're planning on synthesizing later...<br>Ex: You don't have a Manji-Kabura, but have Crescent Arm, Flame Grass, Fish Spear, Mallet, and Golden Sword.<br>Instead of keeping all 5 items in storage, synthesize the other four seals onto Crescent Arm (火水木金).<br>Then you can synthesize that onto a Manji-Kabura in the correct seal order, while cutting down on storage space.</dd>
            <dt>Deposit traps</dt>
            <dd>It's possible to deposit traps obtained in Halfway Well or through the use of a Trapper Bracelet.<br>You could set a Landmine down and use it to destroy unwanted items, or a Strip trap to unequip cursed items.<br>Pitfalls are nice when searching for Perfect Wood in Shuten Trail Mid or Dragon Tile Bracelets in Onigashima.<br>However, if you set a trap down inside the storage, you'll need a Trapper Bracelet to pick it back up.</dd>
            <dt>Be careful with Surprise Pots</dt>
            <dd>Surprise Pots can contain monsters or pent-up anger, making them risky to throw inside the storage.<br>If you do decide to throw one, make sure you won't destroy important items in the event it explodes,<br>and be ready to exit the storage in the event monsters are inside.

            <dd>If you register a <a href="/shiren2/html/system/monsters.html#mixer_family">Mixer</a> with Monster Kingdom, you can synthesize inside the storage as much as you want.<br>You'll want to leave an open spot on the floor so that the synthesized item has somewhere to land.<br>It's not possible to attack ally monsters directly, so another means to defeat the Mixer is needed.<br>You could use a weapon with the 火 seal to chip away at it, but the fastest method is to make use of a Landmine.<br>Place the Landmine in a corner, and trigger it by shooting an arrow when Mixer is next to it.<br>The downside of this method is that you won't be able to leave items near the Landmine.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Example placement:</p>

            □SA■　　A = Arrow or Iron Arrow trap

          </pre>
          <p>Shoot an arrow to the right so that the Arrow Trap activates when Mixer is standing next to the Landmine.</p>
          <p>Another method is to surround a Trip Stone with Sanctuary Scrolls in a corner,<br>and then throw an item at Mixer after synthesizing while a Dragon Tile Bracelet is equipped.<br>Mixer will trip and drop the item, so return it to its pot and send it out again to synthesize<br>without having to go all the way back to Monster Kingdom each time.</p>
          <h3 id="good_items_to_store">Good Items to Store</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Revival Grass</dt>
            <dd>Fantastic item that not only revives you when you collapse, but also restores fullness and strength.<br>You don't need as many once you have a weapon and shield with +99 upgrade value,<br>but it's still a good idea to carry 3 Revival Grass when entering Sealed Room.<br>Recommended to keep 10 or so inside the storage at all times.</dd>
            <dt>Wall Collapse Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Stockpiled when searching for <a href="/shiren2/html/system/golden-interval.html">Golden Intervals</a>.<br>Go ahead and use them up whenever you feel ready to visit the Golden Interval of your choice.</dd>
            <dt>Escape Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Nice for emergencies, or if you're finished with whatever goal you had in mind when entering a dungeon.<br>1~2 is probably enough, but if you want to stockpile more, you can loop 99F of Sealed Room.</dd>
            <dt>Blank Scroll</dt>
            <dd>You can never have too many Blank Scrolls. You might not need other scrolls if you have lots of these.</dd>
            <dt>Restock Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Stockpiled when searching for Dragon Tile Bracelets in Onigashima.<br>No reason to have them in storage once you've obtained the number of bracelets you needed.<br>(7 bracelets = 1 Daisangen Sword + 1 Daisangen Shield + 1 to equip when desired).</dd>
            <dt>Sanctuary Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Nice to have on the floor inside the storage in case monsters appear from a Surprise Pot.<br>Place 3 on the ground in a corner to make it easier to synthesize inside the storage using a Mixer.<br>Can be used alongside Perfect Iron Sand to put on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsLzFz1w6GE">monster battle royale</a> for fun.<br>Sanctuary Scrolls that are stuck to the ground will be reverted to being rolled up when you re-enter the storage.</dd>

            <dt>Identify Scroll</dt>
            <dd>Nice when you want to identify pots or staves inside new dungeons. 2 or so should be enough.</dd>
            <dt>Purify Scroll</dt>
            <dd>It's important to be able to remove curses when checking for equipment upgrade values. 3 should be enough.</dd>
            <dt>Staves</dt>
            <dd>Staves can be used multiple times, as opposed to only once like grasses and scrolls.<br>Keep the helpful ones, and synthesize same name staves together to reduce the amount of space they take up.</dd>
            <dt>Storage Pot</dt>
            <dd>Expanding your inventory is great, though it's not as necessary once you have strong equipment.<br>Keep 11 Storage Pots expanded to a size of 8, since you can carry-in a max of 11 items into dungeons.</dd>
            <dt>Strength Bracelet</dt>
            <dd>Stockpiled for Asuka. It's ideal to have her equip 2 Strength Bracelets at all times.<br>Of course, there's no need to keep them in storage if you prefer going solo.</dd>

          <h2 id="combat_techniques">Combat Techniques</h2>
          <p>This section covers tips against specific monsters, or monsters with similar characteristics as the ones listed.<br>For monsters that aren't listed here, check the individual dungeon or monster pages for more information.<br>These techniques are pretty standard, so it's best to practice them until they become second nature.</p>
          <p>The order of monsters is based on the order of encountering the monsters while playing the story dungeons.</p>
          <h3 id="shuten_trail_easy"><a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/shuten-trail-easy.html">Shuten Trail Easy</a></h3>
          <h4 id="best_way_to_defeat_droplet_ninja">Best Way to defeat Droplet Ninja</h4>
          <p>Monsters that place traps on the ground when they're defeated can be problematic in hallways.<br>Stepping on a Droplet Trap isn't too bad, but a Landmine or Summon Trap is another story.<br>So it's good to get in the habit of having them follow you into a room before defeating them.<br>Also, they won't be able to place a trap if there is already an item or trap on the ground.</p>
          <p>So you can also have them follow you in a way where they're positioned on top of an item or trap.<br>Shop entrances and stairs can block trap placements as well, so they can be utilized if present.<br>If you're sandwiched in a hallway, prioritize defeating the monster that won't place a trap on the ground first.<br>That said, if you find it to be too risky to retreat to a room, you can just defeat the trap placing monster.</p>
          <h4 id="zalokleft_stole_my_item">Zalokleft stole my Item!</h4>
          <p>This is pretty common. Ideally you'd defeat the Zalokleft before it steals, but sometimes it's unavoidable.<br>Zaloklefts warp away after stealing an item, but the monster will always be somewhere on the current floor.<br>The stolen item can be retrieved by defeating the Zalokleft, so if the item was important, be sure to hunt it down.</p>
          <p>Zalokleft will run away from Shiren after stealing, so you'll need to figure out a way to get close enough to attack it.<br>Most maps have a room or hallway that leads to a dead end, so you could chase it into one of those areas.<br>If the map doesn't have a dead end, you can wait in a hallway until it appears next to you.<br>This works because monsters can only see 1 tile ahead when inside hallways,<br>meaning the Zalokleft won't detect Shiren until it's right next to him.</p>
          <p>Items can also be used to catch up to it (ex: Slow Staff), or to defeat it from a distance (ex: arrows, Lightning Scroll).<br>These strategies work for Gamarra and Mr. Drone family monsters as well,<br>but they can be trickier to chase down since most of them move at double speed.</p>
          <h4 id="how_to_fight_horse_ronin_bow_boy">How to fight Horse Ronin and Bow Boy</h4>
          <p>These monsters have a ranged attack, so you'll receive damage if you try to lure them closer by stepping in place.<br>They can only use their ranged attack if Shiren is lined up with them (up, down, left, right, diagonal).<br>So the idea is to move in a way that breaks the line, forcing them to step closer to try and line up again.<br>You'll be able to avoid their ranged attacks, and can attack them directly once they're next to you.<br>This strategy works for most monsters that have a ranged special attack, so it's good to make it a habit.</p>
          <p>Also, note that such monsters can end up hitting other monsters when they use their ranged attacks.<br>This can lead to monsters like Horse Ronin leveling up, which can be quite a problem early on.<br>It's important to move in a way that prevents other monsters from standing between the ranged monster and Shiren,<br>even at the cost of taking an extra hit from an enemy - unless you want to intentionally level them up.</p>

          <h4 id="how_to_fight_boy_cart">How to fight Boy Cart</h4>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/boy_cart.png" width="399" height="160" alt="boy_cart.png">
          <p>Boy Cart not only shoots arrows from a distance, but it also likes to keep a set distance between itself and Shiren.<br>However, it does have a weakness - once it enters a hallway, its field of view will be limited to 1 tile.<br>This means it will repeatedly move forward, see Shiren, and take a step back without attacking.<br>So by luring it into a hallway, you can defeat it without using items or taking any damage.<br>Boy Cart's Iron Arrows have high attack, so this is a valuable technique to remember.</p>
          <p>However, Boy Cart will shoot an arrow if there is a wall or monster behind it, making it unable to retreat.</p>
          <h4 id="luring_gale">Luring Gale</h4>
          <p>If there are 2 open tiles between you and Gale, perform a regular attack to have it move next to you.<br>And if there is only 1 open tile, take a step back to lure it next to you without taking damage.<br>This technique works for all monsters that move at double speed. (But not triple speed).</p>
          <p>Water Strider is a bit of an exception, since it will try to line up with Shiren like Boy Cart if it's carrying an item.</p>
          <h4 id="how_to_fight_kengo">How to fight Kengo</h4>
          <p>Kengo can disarm the shield you have equipped, which at first might not sound too terrible.<br>However, when it disarms the shield, the shield will be knocked away and fly behind you.<br>The shield will be lost if it hits another character, flies outside of the map, or lands on a Landmine, etc.<br>In order to prevent permanently losing your shield, it's best to unequip it beforehand when fighting Kengo.</p>
          <p>But what if you don't have the chance to unequip it, or what if you're about to lose the fight without equipping it?<br>In that case, keep the shield equipped, and move toward a wall so that your back is against the wall.<br>That way even if your shield is disarmed, it won't fly anywhere, and you can simply pick it up.<br>Kengo family monsters are the leading cause of equipment loss, so it's important to remember this.</p>

          <h4 id="how_to_fight_wolf_droid">How to fight Wolf Droid</h4>
          <p>This can be said for all monsters that deal explosions with their special attacks like Wolf Droid and Pop Tank,<br>but it's common for these monsters to level up as a result of defeating other monsters that get caught in the blasts.<br>Unexpected level ups can be scary, so if there is a weakened monster nearby, prioritize defeating it first.<br>That said, you'll likely encounter leveled up monsters even when you're being careful,<br>so keep some items reserved for such a situation so you're not caught off guard.</p>
          <h3 id="onigashima"><a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/onigashima.html">Onigashima</a></h3>
          <h4 id="how_to_fight_twisty_hani">How to fight Twisty Hani</h4>
          <p>Twisty Hani has high HP and defense despite appearing on early floors, so it's difficult to defeat it in a single hit.<br>Its dance will lower your level by 1, which can be devastating if you take a long time to defeat it,<br>so you'll need to come up with ways of defeating it without getting hit by its special attack.</p>
          <p>The safest method is to equip a Level Lock Bracelet, which completely blocks the level down effect of the dance.<br>Only equip it when you're fighting Twisty Hani so that the bracelet lasts a long time.<br>Though some would argue it's not worth taking up an inventory slot for an item that only has one small use case.</p>
          <p>The standard method is to weaken the Twisty Hani with an arrow, and then finish it off with a regular attack.<br>Wooden Arrows lack power, so it's best to use Iron Arrows instead. (or 2 Wooden Arrows).<br>Some other options include the 火 seal on a weapon, cannonballs, stones, staves to inflict status conditions, etc.<br>These can also be used against other monsters, so it's more efficient than keeping a Level Lock Bracelet on hand.</p>
          <p>Twisty Hani is always generated asleep, and only wakes up when Shiren walks next to it,<br>so you can simply ignore them if you don't have the means to defeat them safely.<br>However, defeating a Twisty Hani provides 300 experience points, and they also have a high item drop rate,<br>so it's good to hunt them whenever you have the means to do so.</p>
          <h4 id="checking_for_copycat_mask">Checking for Copycat Mask</h4>
          <p>Copycat Mask monsters are always generated disguised as another monster selected from the current floor's table.<br>There's no way to determine if a monster is real or fake from their appearance.<br>This isn't an issue if you simply defeat the monsters you come across, but can be a problem when<br>you want to synthesize using Mixers, throw an Extinction Scroll at a troublesome monster, etc.</p>
          <p>Here are some characteristics you can watch for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Copycat Mask monsters are always generated awake (excluding Monster Houses), so sleeping monsters are all real.</li>
            <li>An unusual message is displayed when a Knowledge Staff is swung at a disguised Copycat Mask monster.</li>
            <li>The disguise will be canceled if the Copycat Monster is sealed. (Don't use this method to check for real Mixers).</li>
            <li>The disguise will be canceled if the Copycat Monster hits you and you have a shield with the 識 seal (Identify Scroll).</li>
            <li>Likely fake if its attack strength doesn't feel right, or if it never uses special attacks.</li>
