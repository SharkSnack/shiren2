          <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
          <h3 id="diagonal_movement">Diagonal Movement</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/diagonal_movement.png" width="140" height="100" alt="diagonal_movement.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>Diagonal movement is one of the simplest but most important techniques in the game.<br>It might take some practice, but it will help you navigate around monsters, and save on turns in general.</p>
          <h3 id="lure_enemies">Lure Enemies</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/lure_monster.png" width="565" height="106" alt="lure_monster.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>If you encounter an enemy in a room or hallway with a 1 tile gap:<br>
          ＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿<br>
          [Shiren] [　] [Enemy]<br>
          ￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>
          Instead of moving toward the enemy, swing your weapon so that the enemy moves toward you:<br>
          ＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿<br>
          [Shiren] [Enemy]←<br>
          ￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>
          That way you'll avoid giving the first hit to the enemy.
          </p>
          <h3 id="fight_in_hallways">Fight in Hallways</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/use_hallways.png" width="485" height="180" alt="use_hallways.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>If there are multiple monsters in the room, move into a hallway and fight them one at a time.<br>Getting surrounded means you'll end up taking damage from multiple attacks each turn.<br>Shiren can normally only attack one monster at a time, so nothing good will come from<br>trying to take on multiple enemies at the same time.</p>
          <h3 id="step_in_place_to_recover_hp">Step in Place to Recover HP</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/step_in_place.png" width="210" height="150" alt="step_in_place.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>You can step in place and fast-forward turns by holding A+B.<br>This will let you quickly recover HP without moving, and should be done<br>before proceeding to other rooms if your HP is low.<br>However, you'll want to keep an eye on your fullness if you use this technique very often.</p>
          <h3 id="use_items_in_a_pinch">Use Items in a Pinch</h3>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/use_items.png" width="687" height="170" alt="use_items.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>If you collapse in a dungeon, you'll lose all of your items.<br>So if you find yourself in a pinch, don't hesitate to use items.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Herb or Otogiriso to restore HP.</li>
            <li>Swift Grass if you want a movement advantage.</li>
            <li>Warp Grass if you need a quick escape.</li>
            <li>Decoy Scroll if you want to avoid taking damage.</li>
            <li>Arrows or Cannonballs if you want to defeat enemies from a distance.</li>
          </ul>
          And so on - make use of your items depending on your current needs.
          <h2 id="riceballs">Riceballs</h2>
          <h3 id="keep_them_in_storage_pots">Keep them in Storage Pots</h3>
          <p>Riceballs will not spoil over time, but can spoil from outside factors such as stepping on a Spoil Trap.<br>However, they can be protected from spoiling by simply placing them inside pots.</p>
          <p>It might not seem like a big deal during the Shuten Trails since you can buy new riceballs at Shuten Halfway,<br>but lowering the number of turns/actions you can perform before starving is a pretty significant hit.<br>It's best to get in the habit of placing riceballs inside Storage Pots now,<br>so that you'll have an easier time once you reach the later dungeons.</p>
          <h3 id="when_to_eat">When to Eat</h3>
          <p>Ideally, you'll want to eat riceballs when none of the restored fullness goes to waste.<br>For example, if you eat a Large Riceball (restores 100%) at 20/100% fullness, 20% fullness is wasted.<br>So instead, it's best to eat the Large Riceball the moment your fullness reaches 0%.</p>
          <p>Food is extremely valuable, since it increases the number of turns / actions you can perform before starving.<br>Remember, wait until none of the fullness goes to waste before eating, especially during early game.<br>Eating grass items also restores 5% fullness, so it's best to eat them when you're not at max fullness.</p>
          <h3 id="eating_order">Eating Order</h3>
          <p>There are 5 types of riceballs in Shiren 2, and some should be prioritized over others.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>When you don't have a Storage Pot, or have few riceballs:</dt>
            <dd></dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>Giant Riceball</li>
            <li>Large Riceball</li>
            <li>Riceball</li>
            <li>Specialty Riceball</li>
            <li>Spoiled Riceball</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The scariest thing about not having riceballs inside Storage Pots is stepping on a Spoil or Flood trap.<br>No matter how good the riceball is, it'll be reduced to a Spoiled Riceball if you step on those traps.<br>Therefore, you should prioritize eating the best riceballs first to lower the risk of them going to waste.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>When you have a Storage Pot:</dt>
            <dd></dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>Giant Riceball</li>
            <li>Specialty Riceball</li>
            <li>Riceball</li>
            <li>Large Riceball</li>
            <li>Spoiled Riceball</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Giant Riceball should still be prioritized because it increases max fullness by 7%.<br>It's common to end up with multiple riceballs over time when you have a Storage Pot,<br>so the idea is to prioritize eating riceballs with low fullness restoration to free up inventory space.</p>
          <h2 id="level_up_by_defeating_strong_enemies">Level Up by Defeating Strong Enemies</h2>
          <img src="/shiren2/image/other/level_up_monster.png" width="863" height="160" alt="level_up_monster.png" class="image_padding">
          <p>Eating <a href="/shiren2/html/item/grass.html#happy_grass">Happy Grass</a> increases level by 1, but it can also be thrown at a monster to level them up.<br>You can utilize this to create a strong enemy, and then defeat them for a large amount of experience points,<br>with the end result of gaining multiple level ups as opposed to just one from eating the Happy Grass.</p>
          <p><a href="/shiren2/html/item/staves.html#happy_staff">Happy Staff</a> can also be used to level up an enemy monster.<br><a href="/shiren2/html/system/monsters.html#snacky">Snacky</a> can spawn on early floors in dungeons like <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/road-to-the-end.html">Road to the End</a>,<br>possibly resulting in a monster defeating it and leveling up.<br>Leveling up a Pit Mamel into a Cave Mamel early on is highly recommended.</p>
          <p>Of course, higher level enemies are much stronger, so you have to be careful with how you defeat them.<br>There are many ways to defeat high level enemies, but here are some ideas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deal lots of damage in a single hit by throwing Gitan or using Flame Grass, Dragon Grass, etc.</li>
            <li>Slow the enemy or eat Swift Grass, and then loop attack → step back → attack → step back.</li>
            <li>Step on a Poison Trap so that the Poison Arrow hits the monster, lowering their strength to 0.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For example, if you have 5 弟 seals on a shield, 15 HP will be restored every time you get hit by an attack.<br>So, stacking 5 弟 seals pretty much nullifies any attack that deals 15 or less damage!<br>The HP restoration also takes effect when you're hit by ranged attacks like Dragon fire.<br>Furthermore, whereas the HP restoration only takes effect once per turn with weapons (1 attack per turn),<br>there's no limit for shields - you'll restore HP after each and every hit you take on that turn.</p>
          <p>As you can see, 弟 on a shield is easily one of the best seals in the game to help with consistency.<br>Prioritize synthesizing it onto your shield once you reach Shuten Trail Hard.</p>
          <p>Lastly, if you obtain a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/bracelets.html#phantasm_bracelet">Phantasm Bracelet</a> in one of the post-game dungeons, it can be a good idea<br>to synthesize 弟 seals onto your weapon so that you can stay inside walls longer too.</p>
          <h2 id="how_to_handle_curses">How to Handle Curses</h2>
          <p>Equipment found on the ground can sometimes be cursed. (呪 seal).<br>The curse doesn't affect the equipment's strength or abilities, but you won't be able to unequip the item.</p>
          <p>In Shiren 2, only weapons, shields, and bracelets can be cursed.<br>And to reiterate, the only effect of a curse is that it prevents the item from being unequipped.<br>Other item categories cannot be cursed, and upgrade values and abilities are not affected.</p>
          <p>So while it might sound mild compared to other games, cursed equipment can still be troublesome.<br>It prevents swapping equipment, synthesizing, and unequipping bracelets to keep them from shattering.</p>

            <dt>Remove the curse</dt>
            <dd>Some ideas include...</dd>
          </dl>
          <ul>
            <li>Read a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/scrolls.html#purify_scroll">Purify Scroll</a> to remove curses from all equipped items.
              <ul>
                <li>It only removes curses from <strong>equipped</strong> items, so equip cursed items before reading the scroll.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#synthesis">Synthesize</a> in a way that avoids the transfer of the 呪 seal to the base item.
              <ul>
                <li>Curses are synthesis seals in Shiren 2. (呪 seal).</li>
                <li>As long as the base item has filled seals, cursed equipment can be synthesized without the curse transferring.</li>
                <li>However, since cursed equipment comes with -1 upgrade value, the base item will become slightly weaker.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Take control of a <a href="/shiren2/html/system/monsters.html#straw_voodoll_family">Straw Voodoll</a> family monster using a <a href="/shiren2/html/item/staves.html#possession_staff">Possession Staff</a>.<br>　What gets purified depends on the level of the monster:<br>　Straw Voodoll → equipped shields.<br>　Nailed Voodoll → all equipped items.<br>　Spiked Voodoll → all equipment in your inventory, exluding items in pots.
              <ul>
                <li>In other words, if your items get cursed by a Straw Voodoll family monster,<br>you can immediately undo the curse by taking control of them using a Possession Staff.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Let Gyandora pluck the cursed equipment. (It can also pluck other equipment in your inventory).
              <ul>
                <li>Gyandora can pluck your equipped items, including those that are cursed.</li>
                <li>The random seal erasing effect could erase the 呪 seal if you're lucky.</li>
                <li>However, note that the number of seal slots will also decrease by 1.</li>
                <li>Monsoon Doll won't erase the 呪 seal, so they cannot be used to remove curses.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Have the Blacksmith erase the 呪 seal at Shuten Halfway. (Weapon or shield only).
              <ul>
                <li>This only works for cursed items that are not currently equipped.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that Heaven Scroll, Earth Scroll, and Plating Scroll will not remove curses in Shiren 2.</p>

            <dd>The only way to remove curses from Asuka's equipment is for Shiren to read a Purify Scroll while standing next to her.<br>You could try to utilize a Strip Trap or Kengo family monster to unequip her, but it can be a little inconsistent.<br>If all else fails, you could intentionally have her collapse so that she drops her equipment.</dd>

          <h2 id="making_bracelets_last">Making Bracelets Last</h2>
          <p>Bracelets can shatter in Shiren 2, and there is no way to make them unbreakable.</p>
          <p>All bracelets eventually crack and shatter from enemy attacks,<br>but this section aims to examine ways to prevent the inevitable for as long as possible.<br>See the <a href="/shiren2/html/system/gameplay-basics.html#bracelet_durability">Gameplay Basics</a> page for details on durability values / crack and shatter conditions.</p>
          <h3 id="when_to_equip_unequip">When to Equip / Unequip</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Unequip when fighting enemies</dt>
            <dd>This is one of the key rules. You might get away with not unequipping bracelets a few times,<br>but keeping them equipped during fights will guarantee that they crack sooner than later.<br>Other actions can cause bracelets to crack, but monster regular attacks are the most common cause.<br><br>For valuable bracelets like Scout Bracelet, you should unequip them even at the risk of receiving damage.<br>It's also good to get in the habit of keeping Pierce Bracelet unequipped while not in use,<br>so that you don't accidentally lose equipment when throwing items at Mixer or Synthesis Pots at walls.<br><br>That said, there are exceptions to this rule.<br>Bracelets that help evade attacks and effects (ex: Salty, Parry, Paper Thin) or boost offensive power (ex: Strength)<br>should be treated as consumable items and worn when needed during combat.<br><br>※ How to unequip 2 bracelets at the same time<br>If you have 2 valuable bracelets equipped and are about to receive an attack on the next turn,<br>you can insert both bracelets into a Storage Pot to unequip both at the same time.<br>This only works if you have a Storage Pot with 2 or more free slots, but can be good to remember.</dd>
            <dt>Unequip when walking through rooms</dt>
            <dd>This is to prevent bracelets from receiving damage due to traps like Trip Stone, Landmine, Rockfall, etc.<br>Explosions from landmines, bombs, and cannonballs have a greater chance to crack bracelets.<br>They shouldn't break from these damage sources, but a crack signals the countdown to shattering,<br>so if you're the type to skip checking for traps, keep this in mind.</dd>
            <dt>Unequip when advancing to the next floor</dt>
            <dd>There's no way to tell what's waiting for you at the beginning of the next floor,<br>so it's best to unequip bracelets beforehand in case you start in the middle of a Monster House, etc.<br>This is especially the case in deeper floors where Typhoon can shatter bracelets in the blink of an eye.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3 id="dangerous_monsters">Dangerous Monsters</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Ironhead Family</dt>
            <dd>Its head is a ranged attack, but unlike arrows, it's treated as a physical attack so bracelets will take damage.</dd>
            <dt>Taurus Family</dt>
            <dd>Brutal hits seem to have a higher chance to crack bracelets.<br>They're difficult to one-shot thanks to their high HP, so bracelets are likely to take damage from counter attacks.</dd>
            <dt>Pop Tank, Cranky Tank</dt>
            <dd>They fire cannonballs from a distance even if you're not directly lined up with them,<br>often causing bracelets to crack before you have a chance to unequip them if you're caught off guard.<br>Cranky Tank is troublesome in particular because it can fire cannonballs and move at double speed.</dd>
            <dt>Fast Monsters (ex: Gale Family), Nashaaga and Lashaaga</dt>
            <dd>Getting hit by 2~3 attacks per turn instead of 1 means bracelets can shatter that much faster.</dd>
            <dt>Wolf Droid Family</dt>
            <dd>Gorilla Bot and Bear Borg can toss bombs from greater distances.<br>However, unlike Porky family monsters, they only toss bombs if Shiren is within view.</dd>
            <dt>N'dubba</dt>
            <dd>They get a surprise attack in when they reveal themselves, making it easy for bracelets to take damage.<br>N'dubba 60yr ~ 77yr moves at double speed, so it's best to unequip bracelets before picking up items.<br>If that's too much work, at the very least unequip bracelets when you check merchandise inside shops.</dd>
            <dt>Nailed Voodoll, Spiked Voodoll</dt>
            <dd>If your equipped bracelets get cursed, you won't be able to unequip them when fighting monsters.<br>Curses are not treated as seals for bracelets, (bracelets don't have seals to begin with),<br>so unlike weapons and shields, there's no way to protect bracelets through synthesis.<br><br>It's possible to unequip bracelets before Nailed Voodoll has a chance to curse equipped bracelets,<br>but Spiked Voodoll will curse all equipment in your inventory, even if they're not equipped.<br>If you're up against a Spiked Voodoll, you can place the bracelet on the ground or in a Storage Pot.<br>You can also protect bracelets from curses by synthesizing the 祓 seal (Holy Shield, Purify Scroll) onto your shield.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3 id="if_you_still_have_trouble">If you still have trouble...</h3>
          <p>If you still frequently end up with cracked and shattered bracelets despite your best efforts,<br>consider stocking up on either additional copies of the bracelet, or Plating Scrolls to mend cracked bracelets.</p>
          <p>For example, if you have a stock of Scout Bracelets or Phantasm Bracelets inside a Storage Pot,<br>you can swap one out when it cracks and repair it at Shuten Halfway / read a Plating Scroll to mend it later.<br>Scout Bracelets can be found in <a href="/shiren2/html/dungeon/shuten-trail-hard.html">Shuten Trail Hard</a>, so stocking up on them shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
          <p>You could also synthesize the 見 seal (Evasive Shield) or equip a Paper Thin Bracelet to increase evasion,<br>which will help bracelets last longer thanks to enemy attacks missing more often.</p>
