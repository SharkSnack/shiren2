          <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
          <p>Shiren 2 is the story of Shiren when he was still only a child.<br>It's the first game in the timeline, and introduces some of the recurring characters in the series.</p>
          <p>The story begins with wanderer Shiren and talking ferret Koppa traveling together.<br>They come across Napus Village, where the villagers are seemingly troubled by a clan of Oni.<br>Due to a strange coincidence, Shiren ends up having to build a castle to protect the village.<br>He heads off to Shuten Mountain which is full of monsters in search of castle materials.</p>
          <p>Shiren finally completes the castle with help from the villagers.<br>With the castle standing tall, he heads to Onigashima with his allies to teach the Oni a lesson.<br>Onigashima is full of monsters, but he makes it to the top, and duels Boss Oni.<br>Shiren won the fight after a fierce battle, and peace finally arrived to Napus Village.</p>
          <p>Upon returning to Napus Village, he is told of a prophecy.<br>"He will lead a smelly ferret and head toward numerous new dungeons..."<br>New dungeons appear, and Shiren's adventure is just getting started.</p>
          <h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
          <h3 id="shiren">Shiren</h3>
          <p>The protagonist of Shiren 2.<br>He wears an iconic straw hat and a cape with vertical stripes,<br>and travels the countryside with his partner Koppa.<br>Shiren is 10 years old in this entry, and Shiren 2 is the first game in the timeline.</p>

          <p>Shiren is 18 years old in Shiren 1,<br>and it's mentioned that he and Koppa teamed up half a year ago in that game.<br>This seems inconsistent, since they've been together since at least when Shiren was 10 years old.<br>However, an <a href="https://twitter.com/chun_shiren/status/20786496139169792">official tweet</a> exists that says there's an explanation that makes sense.</p>
